<small>THE WORTH OF A TOOTH</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">IT did seem very unjust, and the more they
thought of it the more unjust it seemed, especially
to Priscilla.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I had a tooth pulled out no one
gave me anything,&#8221; she grumbled; &#8220;but Loveday
has a shilling given her for hers, and some sweets,
and such a fuss made.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only had sixpence, and mine was a double
tooth,&#8221; said Geoffrey thoughtfully, &#8220;and I am a boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that being a boy ought to make any
difference,&#8221; retorted Priscilla; &#8220;boys&#8217; teeth don&#8217;t
hurt more than girls&#8217;, and boys ought to be able to
bear it better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but boys always have more in&mdash;in comparison,
just as men do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do they?&#8221; asked Priscilla thoughtfully. &#8220;I
wonder why? I think it ought to be just the other
way, &#8217;cause boys and men are stronger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ll understand some day,&#8221; said Geoffrey
loftily; &#8220;you are too young now.&#8221;</p>

<p>There had been great excitement in the house that
afternoon. Loveday had been having toothache frequently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
for some time. Whenever she drank anything
hot or cold, or ate anything sweet, or put a lollipop in
her mouth, her tooth had begun to jump and ache;
and as she was generally doing one or the other, or
wanting to, Loveday&#8217;s life lately had not been a bed
of roses, any more than had the lives of those who had
to relieve her pain and stop her sobs. So at last her
father had decided that the tooth must go. It was
slightly loose already and decayed, and Loveday was
assured that she would know no comfort while it
remained in her mouth; but if it was taken away
another would soon grow, they told her, and she was
promised some sweets and a shilling when the operation
was over, if she bore it bravely.</p>

<p>Loveday had to think the matter over a little
before she gave her consent, for though she hated
having pain and not being allowed to eat sweets, she
did like to have a wobbly tooth, one that she could
move with her tongue, and she had hoped that if she
waited a little while it would not hurt her when it
wobbled.</p>

<p>But her father told her that that was very unlikely,
and that if she did not have it taken out now it would
fall out some day soon, perhaps while she was asleep,
and then there would be danger of its choking her.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it felled out should I have a shilling and
sweets, father?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>But father, without any hesitation, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear, no&mdash;certainly not.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Loveday consented to the operation. She
wanted the shilling to buy a paint-box with, and she
wanted to see the tooth.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>Then began a great bustle. One servant ran for
a tumbler of warm water, and another for a towel
and different things, and they looked at Loveday so
pityingly that she began to wonder if it would be very
dreadful after all, and grew quite frightened. Then
her father came in, and perched her on the table, and
told her to open her mouth and let him see which tooth
it was; and before she knew he had even seen which
was the right one, she felt a little tweak, and it was
out! She did not cry, for as soon as the pain began it
was over, before she could even make a sound, or screw
out a tear; and then, when she realised what had
happened, every one was petting and praising her, and
calling her a brave little heroine, and Nurse gave her a
box of chocolates, and her father gave her a shilling,
and her mother an extra penny because she had not
made any noise. Priscilla thought it the easiest and
quickest way of earning pocket-money that she had
ever dreamed of&mdash;much easier than catching snails or
pulling weeds.</p>

<p>The extraction itself was far too quickly over to
please Geoffrey and Priscilla, who had been standing
by the table, looking on. Priscilla had covered her ears
that she might not hear Loveday&#8217;s screams, and, after
all, Loveday had not screamed; and having closed
her eyes too&mdash;for when it came to the most exciting
moment she felt she could not look&mdash;Priscilla had
missed everything, and when she unstopped one ear
a little to hear if the screams had begun, she heard
Loveday saying quite calmly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. Now I want my paint-box. Geoffrey,
go and buy it for me at once, please.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>And when Priscilla looked, Loveday was proudly
handing to Geoffrey the new shilling she had just
earned.</p>

<p>It had been arranged beforehand that if she won
it, Geoffrey should run at once and buy her a box of
paints with it.</p>

<p>So, finding that all the excitement was over,
Priscilla decided to go with Geoffrey to buy the
paints, and it was while they were on their way to the
shop that the sense of injustice began to grow in her
small breast, and it grew and grew until, as she stood
in Miss Potts&#8217; toy-shop and gazed about her, she felt
that at least two of the toys she saw there were hers
by right, for she had had out two teeth, and one had
hurt her very much. Geoffrey had not, of course,
such deep cause of complaint, for he had accepted the
sixpence gladly, and if he did not stick out for more at
the time he could not very well say anything now.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what kind of paints is it you want, Master
Geoffrey?&#8221; asked Miss Potts pleasantly when he had
told her what he had come for.</p>

<p>Most of her customers&mdash;and they were not
numerous&mdash;were penny-toy customers, so she was
very anxious to oblige her larger purchasers when she
did get any. Not but what she was polite and kind
to every one who entered her little shop; she did not
know how to be anything else.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a shilling box I want, please,&#8221; said Geoffrey,
as though such a purchase was quite a small matter to
him, and jingling in his pocket all the while the shilling
and a French halfpenny of his own. &#8220;I want <i>Sans
Poison</i>, please,&#8221; he added&mdash;he pronounced it in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
English way, so that it sounded like &#8220;Sands Poison&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;because
then Loveday can&#8217;t harm herself if she
swallows some. She always will lick her brush, and
it&#8217;s no use trying to stop her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Potts, in common with the children, felt the
greatest respect and faith in that mysterious person
&#8220;Sans,&#8221; who, according to their belief, had discovered
how to make paints that any child might swallow and
not die.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d never buy anybody else&#8217;s for Miss Loveday,
if I were you, sir,&#8221; said Miss Potts solemnly. &#8220;You
see, he guarantees them harmless, and we have proved
them to be so, and &#8217;tisn&#8217;t likely that now he&#8217;s made
his reputation he&#8217;d risk it by selling others. But
there&#8217;s no knowing what other folks will put in theirs;
I wouldn&#8217;t trust them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey agreed gravely, while he examined the
box to see that the brushes and saucers were in perfect
order. He was five years older than Loveday, and
felt at least twenty.</p>

<p>Priscilla, who had been wandering about the shop,
eagerly examining its treasures, came up to the
counter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Potts,&#8221; she asked very gravely, &#8220;don&#8217;t you
think that if a double tooth is worth a shilling, a
single one is worth sixpence?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say you&#8217;re right, dearie,&#8221; said Miss Potts
kindly, &#8220;but I never found mine worth anything,
not even for chewing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you have some once?&#8221; asked Priscilla, in
genuine astonishment. The question was excusable,
for she had never seen Miss Potts with even one.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>Miss Potts, quite unembarrassed, laughed good-temperedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes, dearie, of course I had; but I was glad
enough to get rid of them, I can assure you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So should I be if I could get a shilling for each;&#8221;
and Priscilla began to count her teeth, to find out
what wealth might be hers. &#8220;Do you think I shall
have none some day?&#8221; she asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear no, missie; I don&#8217;t suppose so. You&#8217;ll
be looked after too well for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla grew thoughtful.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do think, though, that two teeth ought to be
worth a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked around the shop to see what she could
choose out of all that was there. It was very difficult,
and Geoffrey, having finished examining a top that
had caught his fancy, began to grow impatient.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along, Prissy,&#8221; he said impatiently; &#8220;you
know Loveday will be waiting for us,&#8221; and he strolled
to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall ask father if I may have a hoop,&#8221; said
Priscilla to Miss Potts. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s too
much. There were two teeth, and both hurt a lot,
and oh, how they bled! You never saw such a thing!
Much more than Loveday&#8217;s! But every one pets
Loveday so,&#8221; she added, in a confidential tone,
&#8220;because she is the youngest. They always say, &#8216;Ah,
but she is the baby!&#8217; But she isn&#8217;t; she is nearly
seven years old, and babies aren&#8217;t babies when they
are as old as that, are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, dear, you see folks always think a lot of the
youngest,&#8221; said Miss Potts gently.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>Priscilla nodded her head very soberly.</p>

<p>&#8220;They do!&#8221; she said gravely, &#8220;and of the eldest,
too, I think. Yesterday when granny gave Geoffrey
a book and didn&#8217;t give me one, she said it was given
to Geoffrey because he was the eldest. I don&#8217;t think
it is very nice to be an in-between, do you, Miss
Potts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, dear,&#8221; said Miss Potts, with a deep
sigh. &#8220;I&#8217;d be glad to be anything if only I&#8217;d got
some brothers and sisters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Potts, didn&#8217;t you ever have any?&#8221; Priscilla
was standing at the end of the counter, gazing up
at the tall, thin woman behind it. Miss Potts was
certainly a very interesting person, she thought&mdash;so
much seemed to have happened in her life. Miss
Potts shook her head, and passed her hand across her
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had them, Miss Priscilla,&#8221; she said softly, &#8220;but
I&#8217;m the only one left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very sorry,&#8221; said Priscilla, in a tone of sympathy.
&#8220;It must be dreadfully sad for you; I hope
you didn&#8217;t mind my asking.&#8221; Then, after a moment&#8217;s
pause, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be your sister, if you would like me to,
Miss Potts. Of course, I couldn&#8217;t live with you
always, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what your pa and ma would say to
that, dear,&#8221; said Miss Potts, half laughing, half crying.
&#8220;It is very kind of you to think of it, I&#8217;m sure, but
I reckon you&#8217;ve got brothers and sisters enough
already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, anyhow I can come in very often to see you.
That will make it seem a <i>little</i> less lonely, won&#8217;t it?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
And&mdash; Oh, there&#8217;s Geoffrey running away. I <i>must</i>
go, because I want to see Loveday unwrap her
paint-box. I wonder if she will let me use it too. I
think she might, considering. There are two brushes,
aren&#8217;t there? and she can&#8217;t use both at once. Good-bye,
Miss Potts. I will come again soon. O Geoffrey,
you are mean! You might as well wait, when you
know I am hurrying as fast as ever I can.&#8221;</p>

<small>A DRIVE AND A PINK PARASOL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Geoffrey and Priscilla got back,
they found Loveday seated at the
dining-room table, with a newspaper
spread before her, to protect the
table-cloth, a glass of water and a
piece of white rag beside her, and before her an old
bound volume of <i>Little Folks</i>, already open at the
picture she had selected to paint. Close at her hand
lay a little screw of white paper containing her tooth.
She was all in readiness to begin, and very impatient
at what she considered their long delay.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do think you might have hurried,&#8221; she said, in
an injured tone, &#8220;when you knew that I was not at
all well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter? You are all right now the
tooth is out,&#8221; said Geoffrey teasingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am not. Look at the great hole between
my teefs; it&#8217;s &#8217;normous! I can put all my tongue in,
nearly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t put any paint in, or you might die,&#8221;
said Priscilla. &#8220;Loveday, dear, don&#8217;t you think I had
better paint for you, while you look on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Loveday, who usually said
exactly what she thought. &#8220;Geoffrey has got &#8216;sans<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
poison&#8217; paints, and I&#8217;ve got a piece of rag to wipe my
brushes on, and I am waiting to begin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I think you are very greedy,&#8221; said Priscilla
rather unjustly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am not, I&#8217;ve been ill,&#8221; explained Loveday,
looking up with a grave face and wide blue eyes full
of reproach; &#8220;and when peoples are ill they are &#8217;lowed
to do what they like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you are ill. I think you are only
greedy. I don&#8217;t call having just one tooth out being
ill; but you make so much fuss about everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know how much it hurt me,&#8221; said
Loveday, returning quite calmly to the mixing of her
paints, her short golden curls falling all about her
little flushed face. &#8220;It was&mdash;oh, it was somefin&#8217;
dreadful!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It couldn&#8217;t have been so very bad, or you would
have screamed, I know;&#8221; and with this parting shot
Priscilla walked away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going to watch me paint?&#8221; called
Loveday anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am not,&#8221; said Priscilla shortly. She was
feeling cross and dissatisfied, and she knew she was
behaving unkindly, which did not help her to feel
happier. Geoffrey had disappeared since he brought
back the paint-box, and Priscilla felt dull and miserable;
she could not think of anything she wanted to do.
First of all she wandered up to the nursery, but it
looked lonely, so she quickly came out again, and,
strolling downstairs, went out into the yard.</p>

<p>The afternoon sun was shining hotly, right down
into the yard, bringing out the beautiful scents of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
the mignonette and lemon-verbena in the box on
the kitchen window-sill, and the aromatic smell of the
scenty-leaved geranium. On the ground underneath
the window stood several very large fuchsias in pots;
their branches hung thickly with pendent graceful
blossoms like little dancers, some in pink frocks with
white petticoats, others in white frocks with pink
petticoats, while others, again, had scarlet frocks with
purple petticoats.</p>

<p>All the plants belonged to Ellen, the cook, who had
a perfect passion for flowers and growing plants. One
of the greatest offences the children could commit
was to break or injure any of her treasures in any
way.</p>

<p>Ellen was leaning out of the window now, admiring
her beloved plants, smoothing over the earth with her
fingers, and tidying away any dead leaves, and all the
time she was doing it she talked to the plants just as
though they could hear her and understand. She
picked a leaf of the scenty geranium and offered it
to Priscilla, who took it gratefully, for she loved the
scent, and Ellen was not often so generous.</p>

<p>It was too hot in the yard to remain there long,
and too dull, so Priscilla presently wandered away to
the orchard beyond. The orchard was on the slope
of the hill at the back of the house, and was full of
very old apple-trees. Each of the children had a
favourite tree, and a favourite seat in it. Priscilla
clambered up to hers, and sat there for a few moments,
sniffing at her geranium leaf and looking about her
rather disconsolately; it was so stupid and uninteresting
to be there alone, yet nothing else seemed worth doing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
by herself, and what had become of Geoffrey she did
not know.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder Miss Potts is sorry she has no
brothers or sisters; it must be dreadful to be always
without any. I wonder how little &#8216;only&#8217; girls and
boys play? They can&#8217;t ever have such nice games as
we have.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat up amongst the branches, gazing down
through the shady trees, pondering over this matter
and sniffing at her leaf; and all her life after, the
scent of those geraniums brought back to her mind
the sunny day, Loveday&#8217;s tooth-pulling, Miss Potts,
the old orchard, and the serious mood she was in
there.</p>

<p>Presently the sound of horses&#8217; hoofs on rough
cobble-stones reached her. &#8220;That must be Betsy
being harnessed,&#8221; she murmured, beginning at once
to climb down; &#8220;I wonder if father is going out?&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla&#8217;s love of horses was, then and always, one
of the passions of her life, and of all horses Betsy was
the queen. She hurried through the orchard now to
speak to Betsy, and to see what was happening. In
the yard she found Hocking, their man, wheeling the
carriage out of the coach-house, and Betsy standing,
partly harnessed, looking on. At the sound of Priscilla&#8217;s
step she looked around, and Priscilla, running to her,
embraced one of her legs and kissed her soft warm
shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;You dear!&#8221; she said, laying her cheek against
the old horse, patting her with little loving pats, and
Betsy lowered her head and looked at her little mistress
in a motherly way.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>While Priscilla stood there her father came out to
place a medicine-case in the carriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, little woman,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What are you
doing? Nothing! That&#8217;s a dull way of passing your
time. Would you like to come with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried Priscilla, unclasping Betsy and
clasping her own small hands in rapture, &#8220;may I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if you like. I am going to Lantig, but I
shall be back by tea-time. Hurry in, then, and get
ready, and don&#8217;t spend an age over your toilet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla laughed delightedly, and flew up to her
room. As she passed in and up the stairs, she heard
Loveday&#8217;s shrill little voice calling to her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Prissy, Prissy, <i>do</i> come here! Oh, I do want
some one to watch me paint! Just look what I&#8217;ve
done!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t stay,&#8221; shouted back Priscilla. &#8220;I am
going to Lantig with father, and he told me to hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, somebody <i>ought</i> to stay with me when I&#8217;m
an&mdash;an invalid,&#8221; declared Loveday, in an aggrieved tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, she&#8217;ll be in soon. Go out to the
kitchen and show your pictures to Ellen;&#8221; and on
she ran.</p>

<p>The children had not a real nurse now; Dr. and
Mrs. Carlyon were not wealthy people, and when the
children were no longer babies Mrs. Carlyon had felt
that she must, if possible, manage with only two maid-servants.
But Nurse was so fond of her &#8220;babies,&#8221; as
she called them, that she asked to stay on as nurse-housemaid,
in the place of Prudence, the housemaid,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
who was just leaving to be married, and she did so, to
the delight and comfort of every one.</p>

<p>Priscilla did not call Nurse now to help her to get
ready; she was learning to do a great many things
for herself, and her toilet was a very simple one. She
passed a brush vigorously over her curls, replaced her
sun-hat, plunged her hands into the jug&mdash;it was too
heavy for her to lift&mdash;rubbed the dirt off on the towel,
slipped on a clean holland coat, which she found in the
drawer, and ran down again.</p>

<p>Loveday was standing at the dining-room door,
with a paint-brush in one hand and a cake of paint
in the other; her face was streaked with paints of
different colours.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to go for a drive too. Shall I?&#8221; she
asked eagerly, when she saw Priscilla.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Priscilla, &#8220;you can&#8217;t.&#8221; Then she
suddenly remembered Miss Potts, who was an &#8220;only,&#8221;
and how she longed for a little sister like Loveday,
and how dreadful it would be to be without her, and
quite suddenly her mood changed, and all her ill-temper
vanished.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will ask father,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I expect he
will say &#8216;Yes.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>But father did not say &#8220;Yes&#8221; at once; he thought
it would be better for her not to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be very bad for you, dear, if you got a
cold in that tooth&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I will leave it at home,&#8221; pleaded Loveday
eagerly, &#8220;on the mantelpiece, and wrapped up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not mean the tooth itself, you monkey;
I meant the place where it came out from.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll keep my mouth shut as tight as tight can be,
and put my handkerchief up to hold it all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think if she had a shawl round her face
she would not take cold,&#8221; said Priscilla, with the
old-fashioned motherly air she wore sometimes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, let Miss Persistency come,&#8221; said Dr.
Carlyon, laughing, &#8220;only Nurse had better take some
of that paint off her face first, or the people in Lantig
will think I am bringing a wild Indian to the village.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveday shrieked with delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I wish they would!&#8221; she cried, jumping
about with excitement. &#8220;Then I&#8217;d scream and
growl and frighten them so, they would all run away
from me, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you scream you will get the cold air in that
sore gum of yours,&#8221; said the doctor warningly, &#8220;and
then we shall have you screaming on the other side
of your mouth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveday stood for a moment thinking very seriously,
and moving her mouth from side to side.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do it on only one side,&#8221; she announced,
with an air of disappointment. &#8220;I scream with all
my mouth at once. Daddy, tell me how to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear, no; we don&#8217;t want to have you practising
screaming all day long. Besides, I couldn&#8217;t
now; why, I haven&#8217;t done such a thing since I was a
boy! Now fly! If you are not ready in five minutes I
shall have to start without you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveday vanished in a flash, shouting for &#8220;Nurse!
Nurse!&#8221; all the way she ran.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, quick, Nurse! Do hurry!&#8221; they heard
her calling frantically. &#8220;Dress me quickly; I am<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
going with daddy, and he won&#8217;t wait more than a
minute;&#8221; and then they heard Nurse running, as most
people did run when Loveday called.</p>

<p>In a very short time she appeared again, with a
dainty pink shawl pinned about her neck and mouth,
and in her hand a little pink parasol with white may-blossom
all over it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It matches my shawl, Nurse said,&#8221; she explained
gravely, &#8220;and the shawl <i>is</i> rather hot, so I thought
I&#8217;d bring this to keep me cool. I do think it is so lovely,&#8221;
she went on, gazing admiringly at the parasol&mdash;which
was just a size larger than her hat&mdash;and particularly
at the handle, which had a little bunch of red egglets
at the top.</p>

<p>It certainly was a pretty little thing; it had been a
birthday present, and when it came had filled Loveday
with joy and Priscilla with longing that her birthday
could be changed from December to May, which was
Loveday&#8217;s month.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now jump up,&#8221; said Dr. Carlyon. &#8220;Hocking
is waiting to fasten you in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hocking lifted up Loveday, but Priscilla climbed
up by herself, and seated herself outside Loveday, and
then Hocking passed the strap around them, and
fastened them in safely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I need be strapped in,&#8221; said Priscilla.
&#8220;I am old enough now not to have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better to be fastened in than to be falling out,&#8221;
said Hocking, who never spoke unless he was obliged to,
and then never a word more than he could help. It
did not matter much, for he never said anything but
the most foolish things, though he always spoke with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
an air of the greatest wisdom. Before Priscilla could
say any more Dr. Carlyon came out and got up beside
the children, for he was going to drive himself, and
Hocking was to be left behind. Priscilla was very glad
of that. She did not dislike Hocking, but she liked
best to drive without him. She found it very hard
sometimes to think of things to say to him.</p>

<p>Then at last they started, and drove away up
through the street, where nearly every one had a nod
or a smile for them, or a touch of the hat or a word to
say. The sun was shining brightly, and the air was so
clear that when they reached the top of the hill some
distance out in the country they could see for miles.
In one direction, but very far away, were what looked
like pure white hills; these were china-clay mines,
their father told them, where the clay was being dug
out to make cups and saucers and plates, and all sorts
of things.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think my mug must have come from there,&#8221;
said Loveday gravely; &#8220;it looks all white like that.
Yes, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s the same; it has got &#8216;A Present for
a Good Child&#8217; on it. Don&#8217;t you think it did, daddy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is quite likely,&#8221; said Dr. Carlyon; and Loveday
was greatly pleased.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nice to see where things come from,&#8221; she
said, with a gravely satisfied air.</p>

<p>In another direction they could see the sea; at
least their father told them it was the sea, but to the
children it looked more like the sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the English Channel,&#8221; said Dr. Carlyon.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> think it is heaven&mdash;I mean the sky,&#8221; said
Priscilla. &#8220;Father, don&#8217;t you think that is where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
the earth and the sky join? They must meet somewhere,
mustn&#8217;t they? Do you think if I were to walk on and
on and on&mdash;oh, ever so far&mdash;I should walk right through
into the sky, and not know that I&#8217;d done it until I
found myself with nothing but clouds about me? I
should be lost then, shouldn&#8217;t I? And I could never
get back again, could I? Oh, wouldn&#8217;t it be dreadful
to turn round and find nothing but clouds all around,
and over one&#8217;s head, and under one&#8217;s feet, and nothing
to tell one the way! Just think of it, Loveday;
wouldn&#8217;t it be <i>frightful</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking,&#8221; said Loveday impatiently,
&#8220;and I don&#8217;t want to think any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; went on Priscilla, &#8220;would it be like
a sea-fog, only worse?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Carlyon groaned and shook his head despairingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I am not driven crazy first with trying to
answer your questions,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I will take you one
day soon to that very place, and then you will see for
yourself that it is sea, and not sky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But supposing it isn&#8217;t all sea, but some of it is
sky, and we didn&#8217;t know it, and all got lost!&#8221; Priscilla
looked up at her father with big, awed eyes. &#8220;I shall
hold on to you all the time, father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. I&#8217;ll promise you we won&#8217;t walk
through the clouds by mistake, and if they do catch
us and wrap us round, we will all be wrapped round
together.&#8221;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />


<small>ON THE ROAD TO LANTIG</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">BY the time Dr. Carlyon and the children had
finished discussing the sea and the sky, they
had reached the end of the level high ground
and come to a steep descent, at the bottom of
which was another little stretch of level road,
and then a long, long, rather steep hill up&mdash;Lareggan
Hill it was called. The country around Trelint was
very hilly indeed; as a rule, if you weren&#8217;t going up a
hill you were going down one. Betsy trotted down
now in fine style, and along the bit of level ground, and
the pace at which she went carried her a little way up
the hill before her, but not far. She considered she
had done her duty when she had trotted up a little
way, and was at perfect liberty to crawl up the rest of
it at her own pace.</p>

<p>As soon as they slackened speed Priscilla looked up
expectantly; it was always her duty to drive up the
hills when she was out with her father, while he read
aloud. As a rule, Dr. Carlyon handed the reins over
to her at once, and took out his book. He was a great
reader, and a very busy man, and unless he read while on
his rounds he would have been scarcely ever able to do
so at all. When Hocking was driving him he read
&#8220;to himself,&#8221; but when Priscilla was his companion he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
almost always read aloud to her. Priscilla loved these
readings and these drives more than anything, for
though there was often much that she could not
understand, there was also a great deal that she could,
and some that she put her own meaning to, and some
that her father explained.</p>

<p>But to-day Dr. Carlyon forgot to hand over the
reins. Perhaps he was still busy thinking of the
answers to Priscilla&#8217;s questions, or perhaps Loveday
and her pink parasol made things seem different.
At last, after looking at him questioningly for a few
moments&mdash;as well as she could, that is to say, with
Loveday between them&mdash;she reached out her hand
and touched the reins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father, wouldn&#8217;t you like me to drive now,
while you have a nice little read?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear, dear,&#8221; said Dr. Carlyon, &#8220;I had quite
forgotten. But can you drive, squeezed up as you
are?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is rather a squash,&#8221; sighed Priscilla. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you think we might have the strap undone, father?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her father looked down at them as well as he could
for the pink sunshade.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you might,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to
take four halves of daughters home to mother. I tell
you what we will do: Loveday and her parasol shall
sit on the box-seat behind me, with her feet on your
seat; then she will be safe, unless she deliberately
throws herself out over the back, and I should think
that a young woman with a new paint-box and that
pretty sunshade would try hard not to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Carlyon made Betsy stand still for a moment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
across the road, with her nose in the hedge, where she
contentedly munched the grass while they re-arranged
themselves. Loveday was quite pleased with the
change, for she had not been able to hold up her sunshade
with any comfort to herself or any one else, so
far. If she were not poking it into Priscilla&#8217;s eye, she
was digging her father in the ear, while if she held it
over her shoulder and out behind her, she could not
see it, and that, of course, was what she particularly
wanted to do. So she gladly took the seat given her,
and was not only rid of the strap, but was able to hold
her parasol out over the back and stare at it all the
time. She thought it threw quite a pretty pink
glow over her face; at least, when she shut one eye,
and screwed the other round until she could see her
own nose, her nose looked quite pink, and if her nose did,
of course her face did. She asked Priscilla about it,
but Priscilla was busy attending to the arrangement
of the rugs and the reins, and then to her driving.</p>

<p>Dr. Carlyon coaxed Betsy out of the hedge, produced
a book, and on they went again. It was really
very lovely; the sun was shining, but the breeze was
cool and soft, and the larks were singing and soaring
up, up, up, till nothing was left of them but their
voices; then down, down, down, with a swoop and a
flutter, until they were so low that the children could
see them hovering and darting like big brown musical
butterflies. The scent of clover wafted out from
the fields, and of honeysuckle from the hedges.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I <i>am</i> so glad I was born,&#8221; exclaimed Priscilla,
with a deep-drawn sigh of satisfaction.</p>

<p>Dr. Carlyon smiled.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>&#8220;I hope you will always say the same, and in
that same voice, Prissy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now, what
shall we read? I have the &#8216;Ingoldsby Legends&#8217; here;
shall I read to you about the Babes in the Wood?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please,&#8221; said Priscilla.</p>

<p>She wondered a little that her father should have
chosen anything so babyish. He brought out all kinds
of books and papers to read to her, but they were
always grown-up books and papers, and, as I said before,
Priscilla very often did not understand them. But
to-day it was quite thrilling and fascinating, and
Priscilla listened with a face of deepest sympathy and
not a smile, as she heard of the poor dying parents,
and the woes of the hapless children.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how dreadful!&#8221; she cried, as, later on, her
father read slowly through all the dreadful things
that happened to the wicked old man. &#8220;And his
children let him die in the workhouse? They must
have been very bad children. I don&#8217;t believe the
poor Babes would have done so, if they had
been alive. Loveday and I would have taken
care&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I wouldn&#8217;t!&#8221; broke in Loveday. &#8220;It
served him right for wanting them to be killed. I
wouldn&#8217;t have given him anything if he had asked me&mdash;oh,
ever so many times&mdash;not even a hot-water
bottle, or an &#8216;extra-strong&#8217; peppermint like Ellen
takes. I&#8217;d&mdash;I&#8217;d have pulled all his teefs out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t have minded, I expect, if he had
had a shilling for each,&#8221; said Priscilla, forgetting the
wrongs of the Babes, and remembering her own.
&#8220;Father, I had two teeth out a little while ago, and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
didn&#8217;t have even a penny given me, but Loveday had
a shilling for one!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You poor little injured mortal,&#8221; cried her father,
laughing down at her. &#8220;I expect, though, you have
two nice teeth in place of them by this time; that is
something to be grateful for. Many people would be
glad of two nice, strong, new teeth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Priscilla, nodding her head gravely.
&#8220;Miss Potts would. Do you know, father, she had
out all hers, and nobody ever gave her anything.
Doesn&#8217;t it seem unkind? And she hasn&#8217;t got any
brothers, or sisters either&mdash;she has lost them all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear, dear, how sad! Have you and Miss Potts
been telling your woes to each other, and mingling
your tears? &#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t cry,&#8221; said Priscilla, &#8220;but my throat felt
funny. It must be dreadful to be an &#8216;only&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I was,&#8221; said a little voice over their
shoulders with a deep, deep sigh; &#8220;then p&#8217;r&#8217;aps I
should be able to drive sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla turned round, shocked and indignant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Loveday, you can&#8217;t have everything!&#8221;
she cried. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got a paint-box, and I haven&#8217;t;
and you&#8217;ve got a parasol, and I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t paint here,&#8221; protested Loveday. &#8220;I
want to go home now to see if my paint-box is all
safe,&#8221; she added suddenly.</p>

<p>Priscilla&#8217;s eyes twinkled wickedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised if Geoffrey is home using
all your paints.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveday&#8217;s face fell, and her eyes filled with
anxiety.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>&#8220;Do you really think so? Do you really, Prissy?&#8221;
she asked. Then her face brightened. &#8220;Oh no; he
can&#8217;t be, &#8217;cause I hid them where I know he wouldn&#8217;t
think of looking!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you like to come and sit between us
again?&#8221; asked her father.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, fank you; but I&#8217;d like Priscilla to sit here,
and I&#8217;d have her place and drive. She may hold my
parasol if she likes&mdash;if she doesn&#8217;t open it,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Priscilla is too big to sit where you are. Would
you like to sit down on the mat at our feet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, fank you; but I&#8217;d like to sit where Priscilla
is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But where can Priscilla sit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t she walk just a little way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;d like to sit in her seat,&#8221; persisted Loveday;
&#8220;and put my head on yours, and go to sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, so you want my place as well as Prissy&#8217;s!
You aren&#8217;t at all a greedy little person, are you?
Where are we to sit? On the shafts, or the steps,
or must we run behind? I will tell you what we will
do. I will sit in Priscilla&#8217;s place and hold you on my
knee, and Priscilla shall have the box-seat and drive
us. Will that please your High Mightiness?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that will be lovely,&#8221; agreed Loveday, quite
delighted; &#8220;and I&#8217;ll hold my parasol over us both.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will be charming; only try not to take out
both my eyes. What would mother say if you took
back my two eyes on two tips of your sunshade?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine isn&#8217;t a sunshade,&#8221; said Loveday.</p>

<p>&#8220;Parasol, then. What is the difference between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
a parasol and a sunshade? Do tell me, for I don&#8217;t
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what a sunshade is, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; said
Loveday, with a lofty air, &#8220;but this is a parasol. I
know it said so in the letter that came with it, and the
person who bought it ought to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which has Priscilla? A sunshade or a parasol?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Priscilla hasn&#8217;t got either. You see, her birthday
is in the winter; it would be silly to give her a parasol.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand. If your birthday is in the winter,
you don&#8217;t feel the sun. I expect that is why no one
ever gave me one.&#8221;</p>

<p>At which idea Loveday shrieked with laughter.
&#8220;Fancy daddy with a parasol!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;What
a silly daddy you would look!&#8221;</p>

<p>And in her excitement she lowered her own, and
caught it in Priscilla&#8217;s hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Priscilla won&#8217;t have a wig or a parasol either,
if you aren&#8217;t more careful of her,&#8221; said Dr. Carlyon,
trying to rescue his eldest daughter&#8217;s curls from his
younger daughter&#8217;s parasol.</p>

<small>A ROOMFUL OF BABIES, AND A GIANT&#8217;S CHAIR</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;NOW then, let&#8217;s change places,&#8221; said Loveday
impatiently, as Priscilla&#8217;s last curl was
freed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no; you <i>must</i> wait until we have
quite reached the top of the hill! You
don&#8217;t want to make poor Betsy stand here with the
carriage dragging her back all the time, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fink Betsy would like to stop and rest for a little
while, and I am <i>sure</i> she wouldn&#8217;t mind. She is very
strong, and I am not a bit heavy. I don&#8217;t suppose
she feels whether I am in the carriage or not. Do
you think she does?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She hears you, if she doesn&#8217;t feel you,&#8221; said
Dr. Carlyon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think that Priscilla and I and your
medicine-case, all put together, weigh as much as you
do, father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that if we had waited a year or two before
we chose a name for you, we should have called you
&#8216;Chatterpie&#8217; instead of Loveday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I wish you had!&#8221; cried Loveday. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t
it have been funny: Chatterpie Jane Carlyon? Now,
Prissy, <i>do</i> make Betsy stop; we have come to the very
top. It is quite flat here.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>&#8220;I am going to draw up near that gate,&#8221; said
Priscilla firmly, &#8220;so that I can smell the charlock in
that field.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That horrid weed!&#8221; said Dr. Carlyon. &#8220;You
surely don&#8217;t like that? Whoa, Betsy!&#8221; And without
much coaxing Betsy came to a standstill by the
gate of the field where the charlock grew.</p>

<p>&#8220;I love it,&#8221; said Priscilla, drawing in deep breaths
of the charlock-scented air; &#8220;it always reminds me
of&mdash;of&mdash;oh, something&mdash;drives, and nice things, and
sunny days, and the day you gave me &#8216;Grimm&#8217;s Fairy
Tales,&#8217; father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will get down now,&#8221; said her father, &#8220;then
you must slip up on to the box-seat, and I will get up
on the other side and take Loveday on my lap.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla was delighted. She did not say much,
but she was in a perfect rapture of joy at being given
the box-seat, and allowed to drive on the level, and
even downhill. She had never done so much before,
and she thought she should never, never forget this
happy day. She longed to get down and hug Betsy,
and pat her as her father was doing. Instead, she
looked up at the darting, thrilling larks, and sniffed
in the smell of the charlock. It could not really have
been the scent that she loved, but the associations it
had, and the thoughts it brought to her; and she felt
that she should love it more than ever after this day.</p>

<p>Then Dr. Carlyon got up and took Loveday on his
knee, and on they went again. Presently they saw a
cart coming towards them, and Priscilla&#8217;s heart beat a
little faster as she realised that she would have to pass
it. She did not say anything, but her cheeks grew very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
red, and she felt a great desire to take one rein in each
hand; it seemed to her that she could pull Betsy
in better if she did; but she did not do it; she knew
it was not the right way to hold the reins, and she was
rather proud of her skill as a driver.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know which side of the road to keep, don&#8217;t
you?&#8221; asked her father. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t forgotten the
verse I taught you, have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Priscilla. &#8220;At least, I remember
most of it.</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;&#8216;The rules of the road are a paradox quite.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she paused. &#8220;Um-um, I never can remember
that second line; but it doesn&#8217;t matter, it doesn&#8217;t
tell you anything. I know the others&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;&#8216;If you keep to the left you are sure to be right,</div>
<div class="verse">If you keep to the right you are wrong.&#8217;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Priscilla did not know what &#8220;paradox&#8221; meant,
but she thought the last two lines were wonderfully
clever, and she always said them to herself when she
was driving. The worst of it was, she could not
always decide in a moment which was her left hand
and which her right. She had to think of the nursery
at home, where, if she faced the window, the gas-bracket
was on her left hand, and she had to picture
herself there, facing the window, and then she knew.
But she had not always time to think of those things,
particularly when she was driving.</p>

<p>Now if the boy, who was coming nearer and
nearer, had only drawn in to one side or the other, she
would have known what to do, and would have pulled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
in to the opposite side, but he came right along the
middle of the road, and the only thing he seemed inclined
to do was to drive into them, until at last poor
Priscilla was struck with a sudden panic of alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;please, will you drive&mdash;I&mdash;I
don&#8217;t know where to go!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her father, looking up and seeing what was happening,
took the reins, and as he drew Betsy in to the hedge,
he called out very sharply to the stupid boy:</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep to your own side, boy; do you hear?
Pull to the left. Don&#8217;t take the whole road. Ah,
I see it is Mr. Bennet&#8217;s horse and cart you are in charge
of? Well, I shall tell Mr. Bennet that you must have
a few lessons in driving before you can be trusted
with a horse again. You are a danger to every one
you meet. You were quite right, Prissy,&#8221; he said,
giving her back the reins; &#8220;the drivers should be
next each other when passing, but that boy required
the whole road and the ditches too. Would you
rather I drove now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, thank you, I want to drive again.&#8221;</p>

<p>She felt ashamed of herself for having been so
frightened, and made up her mind to drive past the
next vehicle she met, no matter what it was. A
great hay-waggon with a load of hay on it soon loomed
in sight, and for a moment it seemed as though there
was no room in the road for anything else, but Priscilla
tried very hard not to be foolish. &#8220;The drivers must
pass next each other,&#8221; she repeated to herself; but
this driver was walking at the horse&#8217;s head, and he
was on the far side of the horse. She would have to
go right across the road to pass close by him. &#8220;He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
must be on the wrong side,&#8221; she thought. &#8220;Oh dear,
what a lot of men don&#8217;t know the rules of the road.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they were safely past she drew a big deep
breath of relief, but she felt very glad that she had
managed by herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father, don&#8217;t you think all the boys should be
made to learn at school that verse you taught me;
then they would know better how to drive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do indeed,&#8221; said Dr. Carlyon; &#8220;perhaps they
would remember a simple little thing like that. It
isn&#8217;t much they do remember six months after they
have left school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hocking&#8217;s son Ned can draw a pear beautifully,&#8221;
said Priscilla very impressively, &#8220;but Hocking didn&#8217;t
seem a bit glad. He said, &#8216;Better fit they took and
taught &#8217;em how to grow &#8217;em;&#8217; he didn&#8217;t see what time
Ned was going to have for drawing pears on a bit of
paper when he was &#8216;prenticed.&#8217; Neither do I,&#8221;
added Priscilla gravely.</p>

<p>Dr. Carlyon burst into hearty laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite true,&#8221; he said, &#8220;quite true. I am glad
Hocking has so much common sense, and I foresee
that some day we shall have you sitting on School
Boards, and such-like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla supposed a School Board was some sort
of hard seat or form, but she did not like to ask, though
she wondered very much why her father should laugh
so about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think, though, Prissy, you had better not talk
as Hocking does. It is not quite the way that little
girls should speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla sighed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>&#8220;I wish I was a boy,&#8221; she said earnestly. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t want to sit on School Boards and things, but I
want to talk like Hocking, and to be a miller&#8217;s man,
and drive a waggon with four horses, and shout &#8216;Gee
wug.&#8217; Or else I&#8217;d like to be a Coachman or a bus-driver.
I would rather be a miller&#8217;s man, though,
&#8217;cause I like the little short whip the best; it is so
much easier to crack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; said her father, smiling at her. &#8220;I
suppose that driving poor old Betsy only, and with a
long-handled whip, which is never required, is very
poor fun to you, you ambitious young person!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no; I love Betsy, and I love driving her, but,
of course, I can&#8217;t drive Betsy always; I am going to
earn my own living when I grow up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you have bells on the horse&#8217;s harness if
you were a miller&#8217;s man?&#8221; asked Loveday.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes&mdash;a whole lot of dear little brass ones,
and I&#8217;d keep them always shining like new.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, here we are at Lantig School-house,&#8221; said
Dr. Carlyon. &#8220;Draw up here, Prissy. Would you
two like to come inside, or wait in the carriage?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it vaccinations?&#8221; asked Priscilla.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is vaccinations. I think there will be
about a dozen or more babies to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll come. Come along, Loveday, in, and
see all the dear little babies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla scrambled down, and Dr. Carlyon lifted
out Loveday.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look very warm in that shawl,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
think you might take it off while you are inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveday, though, preferred to keep it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll unpin it,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but I think I will wear
it, &#8217;cause it goes with my parasol, and I am going to
take in my parasol for the babies to see. I think they
will think it very pretty, don&#8217;t you, Priscilla?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Priscilla was already inside the building, gazing
with fascinated eyes at the rows of mothers and babies.
The building, which was the school-house, and stood
a little way outside the village, had been cleared of its
usual occupants, and on the forms, which had been
moved back in two lines along the sides, sat a lot of
country women, each one holding a baby. Such jolly
babies they were, most of them, great, plump, smiling,
healthy, country babies. Some were too young to
notice anything, and just lay asleep, or staring contentedly
about them, but others sat up and looked at
Priscilla and each other and their mothers, and laughed
and crowed, and waggled their bald heads about.
They were all specklessly, spotlessly clean and kissable
in their cotton frocks and big pinafores, and the
mothers looked as clean and tidy as the babies, and
most of them were just as smiling. When they saw
the doctor come in the mothers all stood up and
curtseyed, and Dr. Carlyon had a word and a smile for
each one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Iss, they&#8217;m good enough now, doctor!&#8221; said
one woman, in answer to his remark on the babies&#8217;
good temper; &#8220;but I reckon you&#8217;ll soon set &#8217;em
laughing the other side of their faces, poor dears.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveday, who had become rather shy when she
found herself entering a room so full, stood and looked
with interest at the woman who spoke, and presently
drew nearer to her:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>&#8220;Does your baby scream on the other side of his
face sometimes?&#8221; she asked eagerly.</p>

<p>For a moment Mrs. Rouse looked at her, not
quite understanding her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Iss, that &#8217;e do, missie,&#8221; she said at last, &#8220;and
pretty often too, when he gets contrairy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you would tell me how he does it,&#8221; said
Loveday anxiously; &#8220;I do want to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>But, to her surprise and annoyance, Mrs. Rouse
only burst into a peal of laughter. Loveday could
not bear to be laughed at at any time, but there,
before a whole roomful of strangers, it was really
dreadful, she thought. With very red cheeks she
turned away and walked straight out of the school-house,
and glad she was that she did, for as she left
she heard Mrs. Rouse telling the others what she had
said; after which they all laughed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Loveday was very mortified and angry.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I hadn&#8217;t gone in,&#8221; she thought; &#8220;I
won&#8217;t look at their babies again, if they want me to
ever so much. <i>I</i> think they are very ugly babies,
and&mdash;and I&#8217;ll <i>say</i> so if they laugh at me any
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>She climbed up into the carriage, and perched
herself on the seat, but very soon she remembered
that by-and-by the women and their babies would
all come out by that same door, and she would have to
face them all. When she remembered this she felt
she could not possibly stay there, so she climbed down
again and wondered what she should do with herself.
She walked along the road a little way while she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
pondered, and at last, around a bend in it, she saw to
her great astonishment the &#8220;giant&#8217;s arm-chair.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;giant&#8217;s arm-chair&#8221; stood high up in the
hedge-bank beside the road; it was made of white
granite, and the seat of it was as large as the floor of
a small room; it had also an enormously wide, rounded
back, and two large arms; down in front of it, at one
corner, was a smaller block of granite, which was
always known as the &#8220;giant&#8217;s footstool.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveday had driven past the great chair very
often, and longed to stop and climb up into it, but
until to-day she had never had a chance. In her
delight she forgot all about the women and their
laughter. But, alas! when she reached the chair she
found that the seat was far too high for her to climb
up into by herself; it would have taken a very tall
man to lift her high enough to reach it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, I can sit on the footstool,&#8221; she
thought; but even that proved a climb, and it was a
difficult matter to get up and hold on to her parasol
all the time. She did manage it, though, after a
struggle, and when she sat up on it, holding her parasol
open over her, she felt quite repaid for her trouble,
and very pleased and proud, only she did wish Priscilla
was there too.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if the giant had any little children,
and if they used to sit on this footstool. I expect so.
Oh, I <i>do</i> wish Prissy would come and see me now.
She can&#8217;t really want to stay and look at those babies
any longer.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_f034.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;<span class="smcap">The &#8216;Giant&#8217;s Footstool.&#8217;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Only a very low hedge bordered the road on the
other side, and beyond that stretched a large piece of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
wild moorland, covered with large blocks of granite.
&#8220;That was one of the giant&#8217;s play-grounds,&#8221; her
father had once told her, &#8220;when Cornwall was full of
giants, and very probably the great rocks scattered
about were the stones they had thrown at each other
in play, or when quarrelling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very glad I didn&#8217;t live then,&#8221; thought Loveday;
&#8220;I wonder what happened to little girls like
me. I wonder if they ate them all up! I expect
they did if they caught them sitting in their armchairs,&#8221;
and a little thrill of fear ran through her at the
thought. It was very wild and lonely there, with not
a living thing in sight, except a few big crows cawing
noisily as they flew overhead, and a few goats clambering
about over the moorland opposite her. If one
had not known that there was the school-house and
a little shop and a house round the bend of the road,
one might have felt oneself miles and miles from anywhere,
and anybody. Loveday felt as though she
were, and it really seemed to her that at any minute
a big giant might come striding along the wide white
road to have a rest in his chair, and would catch her!</p>

<p>Of course, she did not really expect him, and she
knew there were no giants nowadays, but she felt she
would rather like to see Betsy again, and be safely in
the dear old carriage, where there were rugs and
things to hide under, and she at once scrambled down
from the footstool and ran, not because she was nervous,
of course! but because she wanted a change, and to
see Betsy.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Betsy, I am so glad to see you!&#8221; she cried,
as she ran up to the dear old horse and hugged her;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
and Betsy, who had been having &#8220;forty winks,&#8221;
opened her eyes and looked down at her little mistress
with what was certainly a smile, and she put down her
soft nose and snuzzled her affectionately. Once more
Loveday mounted the carriage, but as she did so she
remembered the mothers and babies in the schoolroom.
&#8220;Oh dear,&#8221; she cried impatiently, &#8220;it seems
to me I can&#8217;t get any rest; if it isn&#8217;t giants it&#8217;s mothers!
But I know what I&#8217;ll do: I will lie down here, and
when I hear them coming I will pull the rug up over
me so that they can&#8217;t see me.&#8221;</p>

<p>So she curled herself up on the lower of the two
seats, with the rug all over her except her head. She
was only to pull it right up when she heard any of them
coming. But at one moment she thought she heard
the handle of the door being turned, and then she
thought she heard voices and footsteps coming out;
and she had so many false alarms and grew so nervous
that at last she snuggled right down under the rug
and stayed there, and then she forgot to listen, and
somehow, instead of being in the carriage she was in
the giant&#8217;s oven, and oh, it was so hot there she felt she
was being suffocated, when suddenly the oven door
was opened, and such beautiful cool air rushed in,
and&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what has the child wrapped herself up
like this for?&#8221; exclaimed a voice; &#8220;she must be trying
to cook herself, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps she is afraid of getting a cold where
her tooth came out,&#8221; said another voice, which was
Prissy&#8217;s. Loveday roused herself, and sat up and
stretched; she was very hot and tumbled, and rosy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
and she could not remember for a moment what had
happened. Then out came a woman with a crying
baby in her arms. Loveday recognised Mrs. Rouse,
and wanted to be under the rug again.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, missie! He&#8217;s laughing the other side of
his face now,&#8221; she said, smiling good-temperedly up
at Loveday, and holding out the sobbing baby for her
to see.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he is at all pretty, whichever side
he smiles,&#8221; said Loveday very crossly, and without a
ghost of a smile on her own face. She knew she was
rude and unkind, but she felt at that moment that
she wanted to say something nasty, and she said it.
Priscilla was shocked, and her father was vexed with
her, but Mrs. Rouse only laughed good-temperedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was your pa that made him to. You must ask
him to learn you how to laugh the other side of your
face.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to know, thank you,&#8221; said Loveday
shortly. &#8220;Prissy, will you pin up my shawl, please?
If I talk any more I shall catch a cold in my
mouth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla got up, and, kneeling on the seat beside
her little sister, arranged the shawl very carefully
about her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t speak like that if I were you, dear,&#8221;
she said gently; &#8220;Mrs. Rouse is such a nice, kind
woman, and she doesn&#8217;t understand that you don&#8217;t
like her&mdash;her joking.&#8221; Loveday jerked away her
head quite crossly, but Priscilla went on. &#8220;If you
laugh and don&#8217;t take any notice, they won&#8217;t think
anything about it; but if you look so cross and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
say nasty rude things, they will talk ever so much
about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveday saw the sense of this, and it seemed so
dreadful that she forced herself to be less disagreeable,
and to look at some of the other babies, and even
to smile at some of the mothers, but she could not
forgive Mrs. Rouse quite yet.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />


<small>SWEEPING THE DRAWING-ROOM</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE day after the drive to Lantig, Mrs.
Carlyon was having a large &#8220;At Home&#8221;
in the afternoon&mdash;large, that is, for Trelint&mdash;and
all the household was very busy.
There were cakes to make, and biscuits,
and tea-cakes, and sandwiches, and ices, and all kinds
of good things, for there were not many shops in
the town; besides which, it was considered a point
of honour to make most of the things at home.</p>

<p>Ellen always grew very cross at these times, but
she cooked her best, for every one in Trelint knew who
Dr. Carlyon&#8217;s cook was; just as every one knew how
many servants every one else had, and who they were.
Nurse, too, was not as patient as usual, she had so
many things on her mind, for where there are only
two maids to help, a big party makes every one very
busy, and the children had to amuse themselves as
best they could&mdash;at least, Priscilla and Loveday had
to; Geoffrey had gone to spend the day in the country
with some friends, glad enough to escape &#8220;such silly
things as At Homes,&#8221; he said. Priscilla and Loveday
almost wished that they had been invited too, for
the day seemed very long and dull without mother, or
Geoffrey, or Nurse. They were told, too, to keep in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
the nursery and play, for they would be in the way anywhere
else, but to be told to amuse oneself makes it
a very difficult thing to do; everything seems, at once,
to be not the very least bit amusing.</p>

<p>The dining-room was to be arranged for the guests
to go to, to partake of tea and coffee when they arrived;
and the drawing-room was, of course, to be decorated
with flowers, and arranged a little differently. Priscilla
and Loveday were not wanted anywhere, and they
could not play in the garden, for there had been heavy
rain during the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear!&#8221; sighed Priscilla, &#8220;there is nothing,
nothing that I feel I want to do, and there is more
than an hour before we can see the guests coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveday glanced at the clock, too. &#8220;So there
is,&#8221; she sighed; &#8220;it isn&#8217;t free yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly,&#8221; said Priscilla crossly; &#8220;you know
you can&#8217;t tell the time, so why pretend?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said so, too,&#8221; protested Loveday; &#8220;and I
know the people are going to begin to come at four,
&#8217;cause mother said so, and if it is more than an hour
before they come, that shows that it isn&#8217;t free yet by
the clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>In her heart Priscilla thought that it was very
clever of her little sister to have found out all that,
but she did not tell her so; she thought Loveday was
a vain enough little person already. She dropped
down with a weary sigh beside her doll&#8217;s house, but
they had already given that a thorough cleaning from
top to bottom, and there was nothing more to do to
it. They had dressed and undressed all their dolls
and put them to bed, so that they were settled for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
night, and wanted no more attention. Every animal
had gone out of the ark for a walk, and marched back
to it again, and there really seemed nothing left to do
that was worth doing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>wish</i> I could help mother,&#8221; sighed Priscilla,
who always loved real work much more than play
work&mdash;she would far rather help to dust a room than
dust or tidy her doll&#8217;s house; &#8220;and if they are so
busy,&#8221; she added, &#8220;I am sure there must be lots that
I can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>After another moment or two had passed, she shut
the doll&#8217;s house door with a bang, and got up from the
floor. &#8220;I am going downstairs just a teeny-tiny way,&#8221;
she said softly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you come too, Loveday; you
needn&#8217;t do everything that I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was really too much to expect Loveday to
stay in that dull nursery by herself, and very soon she
was creeping out after Priscilla.</p>

<p>Priscilla had reached the foot of the nursery stairs,
and was standing on the landing looking over the
banisters, and listening for any sounds of life below,
and Loveday joined her. No one was about, that
they could see, but from the dining-room came the
rattle of china. Presently, however, they heard their
mother&#8217;s voice; she was speaking to Nurse.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will leave you to finish arranging the cups and
saucers,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and I will go to the kitchen and
place the cakes out on the plates; then it will be time
for me to dress. I ought to rest for a few minutes, for
I am so tired already I can scarcely stand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla and Loveday drew back while their mother
passed along the hall below, for they did not want to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
be seen; they were doing no harm, they thought, and
it was very much more interesting to be there than in
the nursery. They must run away, though, before
mother came upstairs to dress, but by that time it
would be nearly time for them to watch from the
nursery windows to see the first guests arrive.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do wish I could help mother,&#8221; sighed Priscilla
again. &#8220;She is so tired, and has such lots to do.
Can&#8217;t we do something to help? Oh!&#8221; with sudden
delight, &#8220;I know what I&#8217;ll do! I&#8217;ll dust the drawing-room!
Now, don&#8217;t you come too, Loveday. I
thought of it first, and I can do it by myself, and you
are sure to break something and get us both a scolding.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Loveday was not to be put off in that way,
and, to save a howl, Priscilla said, &#8220;Well, come along;
you may come if you will promise to be good.&#8221;</p>

<p>The drawing-room was on the very landing on
which they stood. Priscilla crept over to the door
and looked in. Of course it was empty, and to her
it looked as though the furniture had all been pushed
back, just as when the room was going to be swept,
only there were no dust-sheets over the things.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe it hasn&#8217;t even been swept yet!&#8221; she
whispered, in a shocked voice. &#8220;We&#8217;ll sweep it first,
shall we?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a grand idea, and Loveday agreed delightedly.
Nurse still kept her nursery brushes in a
cupboard on the top landing; they would get those,
then no one would know what they were doing, and
when Nurse came up presently, all hot and tired, to
sweep and dust the room she would find it all done,
and have a most beautiful surprise; and she would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
not scold them at all; she would be so glad, and
perhaps she would let them have some of the &#8220;At
Home&#8221; cakes for their tea!</p>

<p>They hurried up the stairs very gently, and Loveday
carried down a long-handled brush, while Priscilla
carried the dustpan in one hand and the brush in the
other, so that they should not clatter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now close the door,&#8221; whispered Priscilla; and
Loveday turned to do it, bringing her broom-handle
with a sharp tap against a picture which hung by it.
Priscilla was too busy to hear the blow, or to see
what had happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was such a <i>little</i> tap,&#8221; said Loveday to herself,
as she gazed ruefully up at the crack which ran quite
across the glass of the picture.</p>

<p>Priscilla was on her knees by that time, brushing
the carpet as hard as she could with the short-handled
brush.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall I do?&#8221; asked Loveday. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
use this brush; it is so tall it knocks my head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall dust,&#8221; panted Priscilla, looking up with
a very red face.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I haven&#8217;t a duster!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a handkerchief, haven&#8217;t you? Use
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t,&#8221; said Loveday.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how you do worry! Here, take mine!&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveday pounced on it gladly, and began to rub
the legs of a chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think mother will be surprised to see the carpet
so well swept. Won&#8217;t she?&#8221; said Priscilla contentedly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>&#8220;Yes; and to see everything so well dusted.
P&#8217;r&#8217;aps the guests will notice it, too, and will say,
&#8216;Here, Mrs. Carlyon, is sixpence for the person who
dusts your room so well.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Priscilla scouted the idea with the utmost
scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;As if they would!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Why, you silly
child, people don&#8217;t say things about other people&#8217;s
rooms, not even if they aren&#8217;t dusted at all. Of
course, you can dust easy things like chairs, but I&#8217;ll
have to do the vases, and all the&mdash;take care, Loveday,
the door is opening; oh, do mind your head!&#8221; and
Loveday stepped back just in time to allow the door
to be opened a little way. &#8220;Who is there? You
can&#8217;t come in yet,&#8221; cried Priscilla.</p>

<p>But the door opened wider, and Nurse&#8217;s agonised
face appeared, and behind her, gazing amazedly at
Priscilla through a haze of dust, stood Lady Carey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Priscilla! Oh, what <i>are</i> you doing? Oh,
you naughty, naughty, mischievous children!&#8221; cried
Nurse, horrified, and not knowing what to do, or
which to attend to first. &#8220;Excuse me, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; she
said, turning to the visitor, &#8220;but&mdash;but&mdash;oh, what can
I do? The guests will all be coming in a few minutes,
and the room is like this!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Carey smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are the little people too zealously industrious?&#8221;
she asked. She saw at once that something was amiss,
and wanted to make as light of it as possible. &#8220;How
do you do, children? Are you Mrs. Carlyon&#8217;s two
little daughters?&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla dropped her brush, sprang to her feet,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
and went forward to shake hands. Her checks were
crimson with hard work and shame.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do?&#8221; she said breathlessly. &#8220;Yes,
I am the eldest; I am Priscilla, and this is Loveday.
Loveday&#8221; (in an angry aside), &#8220;stop dusting, <i>do</i>! I
am very sorry the dust is flying,&#8221; she went on, turning
to Lady Carey again. &#8220;We wanted to help mother
and Nurse because they were so busy getting ready
for the &#8216;At Home,&#8217; and I was sweeping the carpet
and Loveday was dusting the easy things, like
chairs and table-legs, but we didn&#8217;t know it was
time for the guests to be coming. Nurse,&#8221;
turning to her with a distressed air, &#8220;what can
we do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you <i>very</i> early?&#8221; asked Loveday of Lady
Carey, as soon as she had shaken hands with her, and
said &#8220;How d&#8217;ye do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see, dear, I am not come to the &#8216;At
Home&#8217;; I did not know your mother was having one.
I came to return your mother&#8217;s call, and I have
unfortunately chosen an inconvenient day.&#8221; Then,
turning to the servant: &#8220;The dust has gone, I think,
and I can sit here&mdash;unless, of course, you want to be
going round with a duster.&#8221; But before Nurse could
reply she went on: &#8220;No, I tell you what I would much
rather do, and what would be by far the best plan,&#8221;
she added kindly; &#8220;I have some other calls to pay,
and Mrs. Carlyon is very busy, and as I wanted to
have a nice long talk with her, I will go away now
and come one day soon when she has more time.
Don&#8217;t tell her about this call, at least until after all
her guests have gone, and then be sure to tell her I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
quite understood, and would rather come when I
can have her all to myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;but I am sure my mistress would wish
to see you, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said Nurse, who was perplexed
to know what she ought to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; said Lady Carey; &#8220;but it would
be much more pleasant for us both if I called another
day. Now let me out, and hurry back to set this
room to rights. It is striking the quarter to four.
Good-bye, children. I hope I shall see you again
soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; said Priscilla, but very, very
shamefacedly; and as soon as Lady Carey had gone
she flew up the stairs to her own room, and, flinging
herself on her bed, burst into tears of shame and
pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I meant to help! I meant to make such
a nice surprise for mother, and oh! I&#8217;ve done such
a <i>dreadful</i> thing!&#8221; and poor Priscilla sobbed and
sobbed until her head ached.</p>

<p>Presently soft footsteps came lightly up the stairs
and to her room, but Priscilla, with her hot face
buried in the bed-clothes, did not hear them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Prissy, dear,&#8221; said her mother, as gently and
kindly as though nothing had happened, &#8220;will you do
something for me? Will you run down very quickly
and help Nurse to dust the drawing-room? If you
will help her, there will be just time to set it all straight
again before our guests arrive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla scrambled off the bed in a moment, and
pushed her hair back from her face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>&#8220;Here is a nice soft duster,&#8221; said mother; &#8220;run
quickly, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Priscilla, using the soft duster to mop her
eyes with, stayed for just a moment to throw her
arms about her mother&#8217;s neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;I do think you are the very
nicest mother in all the world. I <i>am</i> so glad I haven&#8217;t
got any other,&#8221; and she hugged and kissed her again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t wipe your eyes on the duster any
more, dear,&#8221; said Mrs. Carlyon laughingly, and returning
the kiss, &#8220;or it will make the things quite
dull instead of polishing them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla did not answer; she was gazing at her
mother, lost in admiration. Mrs. Carlyon had on a
pretty brown silk gown, trimmed with bands of little
pink roses and green leaves, and the gown suited her
fair hair and delicate complexion to a nicety.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder father married you, mother.
You do look nice in that gown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Run away and dust my drawing-room,&#8221; cried
Mrs. Carlyon, laughing again, &#8220;and don&#8217;t waste time
thinking of flattering things to say to your mother.
Hurry; it is close on four, and people will be coming
soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; thought Priscilla, as she ran off, &#8220;if
I shall ever have a gown like that. But&#8221;&mdash;with a
sigh&mdash;&#8220;if I had I shouldn&#8217;t look as pretty in it as
mother does.&#8221;</p>

<small>MRS. TICKELL, MRS. WALL, AND AN ACCIDENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;INFANTS!&#8221; said Geoffrey, popping his head
round the nursery door, &#8220;come up in the
orchard; I&#8217;ve rigged up such a jolly swing
there!&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla and Loveday looked up from their
play quite excited by the news. They were keeping
a shop at the moment&mdash;a book-shop&mdash;and had all
their nursery books and all the bits of paper and string
they could collect arranged before them on the
window-seat, which made a splendid counter. Books
made such nice parcels, and were so easy to wrap
up. On the counter, too, they had an old Japanese
jewel-case that their mother had given them some
time ago; it had two drawers, with handles, so made
a beautiful till for their money, and they were doing
such good business that already the till was heavy
with the weight of the cowries it held.</p>

<p>Priscilla had just wrapped up her &#8220;Playing Trades,&#8221;
and handed it across the counter to a customer,
saying, &#8220;That will be half-a-crown&mdash;thank you,&#8221; and
was searching the till for a sixpenny-piece, when
Geoffrey opened the nursery door and popped his
head in. Business came to a standstill at once, and
the two little shopwomen hurried away, leaving books,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
and till, and everything. Half-way down the stairs
Priscilla stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Loveday,&#8221; she said, &#8220;don&#8217;t you think it would
be rather nice if you bought some sweets with your
penny, and we ate them while we were swinging?&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveday nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will both wait for me while I am gone to
buy them, won&#8217;t you? You won&#8217;t be mean, and go
on and begin to swing till I come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Geoffrey; &#8220;we&#8217;ll wait if you
don&#8217;t take too long.&#8221; Loveday, being the only one
possessed of any wealth, had to be treated with consideration.
&#8220;Cut along, infant!&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveday had actually taken two steps, but
Geoffrey&#8217;s words brought her back again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you ought to call us infants,&#8221; she
said severely. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t sound at all nice, and if
you do it again I don&#8217;t think I shall give you a single
sweet. We aren&#8217;t infants; father said so. Infants are&mdash;are&mdash;well,
we aren&#8217;t infants.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we will go on and begin to swing,&#8221; said
Geoffrey, to tease her&mdash;&#8220;don&#8217;t you, Prissy? If we
wait for the end of this conversation I am afraid the
tree will die of old age.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how you can like to be such a rude
boy,&#8221; said Loveday cuttingly. &#8220;Nobody thinks rude
boys funny or nice.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were two sweet-shops quite near to Dr.
Carlyon&#8217;s house, and the children were allowed to go
alone to both of them. Mrs. Tickell&#8217;s was on one
side of the street, and Mrs. Wall&#8217;s was almost opposite.
Mrs. Tickell was the favourite with the children; she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
was always more pleasant and smiling and patient than
Mrs. Wall, and gave more generous measure. On the
other hand, the children found Mr. Tickell rather a
drawback. True, he was not often in the shop, as he
was generally busy in the bakehouse, for the Tickells,
in addition to having sweets and apples, and prize-packets
and little china figures, made cakes and pasties
and jam-tarts to sell. But when Mr. Tickell was in the
shop he always stood by the half-door, and asked the
most trying questions, such as: &#8220;Now, can you say to
me your six times right through without a mistake?&#8221;
or, &#8220;Can you tell me when Henry the Eighth began
to reign?&#8221; Once he even asked Geoffrey to say his
dates right through, before the Conquest and all. It
was really dreadful, and as he always stood by the door,
there was no escaping him.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Tickell was so kind, and Emily, their
daughter, was so beloved by the children, that they
bore with Mr. Tickell for their sakes, and the shop
remained their favourite.</p>

<p>Mr. Wall was of no account at all; the children
had a notion that he would be kind if he were left
to himself, but that he was afraid of Mrs. Wall. He
very seldom spoke, and when he did it was only to
say something that they all thought very silly, such
as &#8220;Fine weather this for little ducks,&#8221; or something
equally aggravating. So they put him down in their
minds as a weak creature, and took very little interest
in him. Mrs. Wall was a very solemn and unsmiling
person. She never grew friendly as Mrs. Tickell did.
Priscilla heard some one once telling a story of the
Walls&#8217; only son, who had died, she gathered, in some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
tragic, mysterious way a long time ago, before she was
born or was old enough to remember anything. But
what struck her even more than the story was the
remark, &#8220;And Mrs. Wall has never smiled since.&#8221;</p>

<p>After that, whenever she was within sight of Mrs.
Wall, Priscilla was always watching her to see if this
was true or not. She would hardly believe that she
did not forget sometimes, and smile before she remembered;
but Priscilla had never yet seen her
do so.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be dreadful for Mr. Wall to have her
always looking so&mdash;so cross,&#8221; she confided to her
father one day. &#8220;As for him, I don&#8217;t think he could
smile if he wanted to; his mouth is so very wide it
couldn&#8217;t possibly go any wider.&#8221;</p>

<p>To-day Loveday ran off with her penny in her
hand to buy some bull&#8217;s-eyes at Mrs. Tickell&#8217;s, but,
as usual, she examined both the shop windows
thoroughly first, that she might get some idea as to how
best to lay out her money, and she was very glad she
did, for in Mrs. Wall&#8217;s window there was quite a large
assortment of new things; there were pink and white
sugar mice, black liquorice babies with red lips and
blue eyes, sugar bird-cages, and little cocoa-nut fish-cakes.
They were all two a penny but the mice, and
those were a farthing each.</p>

<p>Loveday felt, after gazing for some time, that she
must have one of the dolls, and that she wanted two
of the mice. So she pushed open the shop door and
went in. A bell behind the door jangled loudly, so
Loveday knew that Mrs. Wall was upstairs &#8220;cleaning,&#8221;
and that Mr. Wall was absent, for the bell was always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
unhung and placed on the counter if they were at
hand.</p>

<p>Loveday liked to find the shop empty&mdash;it gave her
time to look about; but to-day, when she had looked
about her for a few minutes, she remembered that
Geoffrey and Priscilla were waiting for her, and would
begin without her if she did not make haste, so she
hammered sharply on the counter with her penny,
to make Mrs. Wall hurry. Silence followed. She
waited again what seemed to her a very long time,
then knocked once more, this time even more loudly.
Still silence.</p>

<p>During the next few minutes Loveday quite
changed her mind as to what she would spend her
money on. She suddenly remembered that Emily
Tickell had told her she had some beautiful rose-drops
coming in, and some honey-drops; and Loveday loved
both. Besides which, the thought crossed her mind
that it might not be easy to divide the two mice
and the one doll. The mice were very hard to break,
and she could not give the whole doll to one; it would
not be fair. She wished then that she had not come
to Mrs. Wall&#8217;s, and was just wondering if she could
creep out of the shop again without being seen, when
she heard a sound, and Mrs. Wall opened the little
glass-topped door, and came up the two steps leading
from the parlour to the shop. She looked rather
crosser and sterner than usual.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had only just gone up to change,&#8221; she said
sharply, &#8220;and as sure as ever I go, that bell is certain
to ring. What can I do for you, miss?&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveday felt uncomfortable; her heart was quite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
set now on getting the rose-drops and the honey-drops,
and not the doll or the mice, but what could she say
or do! Then a way out of her difficulty suddenly
opened out before her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, can you change a penny for me?&#8221; she
asked very politely.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wall did not say anything, but her lips set
a little more tightly than usual as she went to the
till and took out two halfpennies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Loveday, with a sigh of relief,
and, hurrying out, she flew across the road to the
Tickells&#8217; shop, almost opposite. As she reached the
door she glanced back for one more look at Mrs. Wall&#8217;s
fascinating store, but all she saw was Mrs. Wall&#8217;s cold
stern eye looking after her with anything but an
amiable expression in it, and she turned with relief to
Emily Tickell&#8217;s welcoming smile.</p>

<p>When at last she reached the orchard with her
two precious packets in her hands, Geoffrey and
Priscilla were busy arranging a bit of wood for a seat
for the swing. They had not been swinging, they
assured her, at least only just trying it to see if it was
all right, and Loveday was satisfied and distributed
her sweets.</p>

<p>But as soon as the sweets were in their mouths
they began, and what a glorious time they did have
for a while!</p>

<p>They swung so high, and it seemed so dangerous
and exciting, and sometimes they took it in turns to
swing, sometimes two got on together, and once even
the three of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps we hadn&#8217;t better all get on together<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
again,&#8221; said Priscilla after that, looking at the slim
skipping-rope they had all been depending on. &#8220;It
isn&#8217;t a very strong one, is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Strong enough,&#8221; said Geoffrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s play something else now,&#8221; said Loveday,
flinging herself down on the grass. &#8220;I am tired of
swinging, and it makes me feel rather sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla was sitting in the swing, just lazily moving
it. &#8220;What shall we do, then?&#8221; she asked reluctantly.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we will stop <i>quite</i> yet; let&#8217;s go on for
a little while longer, just one or two more swings, and
you watch us, Loveday, like a darling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t watch you,&#8221; said Loveday; &#8220;it makes
my head swing too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you what,&#8221; said Geoffrey, &#8220;we&#8217;ll just have
one more good turn, then I&#8217;ll get out the sticks and
hoops, and we&#8217;ll have a game of &#8216;La Grace.&#8217; You
sit where you are, Prissy, and when I&#8217;ve given you a
good start I&#8217;ll spring up at the back of you. Loveday,
you can look away if it makes you giddy;&#8221; and with
the same he sent the swing with Prissy in it flying up
through the air, then back she came, and up she went
again and back; but this time Geoffrey held on the
ropes, and as the swing swung forward the third time,
he sprang up on his feet on to the seat. The ropes
quivered and strained, and for a moment their flight
was checked; then on they went again, up and down
and up; then, with a scream and a heavy thud, they
both came down to the ground, Priscilla underneath,
Geoffrey on top of her.</p>

<p>Loveday was too bewildered to cry or to scream.
At first, in fact, she did not realise what had happened.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
She thought they were playing some game, and that
in a moment they would both jump up with a laugh
and a shout; and yet&mdash;Priscilla was so very white
and still, and lay so long, and though Geoffrey often
groaned in fun and pretended to be hurt, it was somehow
not quite like this; and when at last Geoffrey
tried to get up, but only screamed and fell back again,
Priscilla still never made a sound or a movement.
Geoffrey made one more effort, and dragged himself
off Priscilla; but he could not get up, for every time
he tried to raise himself on his arm, the pain was greater
than he could bear.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I&#8217;ve broken my shoulder&mdash;or something!&#8221;
he gasped. &#8220;Loveday, run quick, and tell
some one to come! Get father, and&mdash;Prissy, Prissy&#8221;&mdash;he
broke off to call his sister. &#8220;Oh, why doesn&#8217;t she
open her eyes? Prissy, speak; do speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>He tried to move her, but he could not manage
that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Run, Loveday, as fast as ever you can&mdash;do!&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked so ill and scared, and Priscilla looked
so dreadful, lying so still with her arms all crumpled
up under her, that Loveday nearly fainted with fear;
but she ran and ran as she had never run before, and
all the way her clear shrill voice rang out: &#8220;Daddy,
mother, Nurse, come quick! Where are you? Oh,
do come!&#8221; She called so loudly, and there was such
real distress in her voice, that by the time she reached
the house her father was hurrying out to meet her;
and before she had gasped out half her tale of woe,
he had gathered her up in his arms, and, followed
by, it seemed, the whole household, was rushing to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
the orchard, where Priscilla lay as Loveday had left
her, and Geoffrey, as pale now as Priscilla, was still
struggling to get up and at the same time to choke
back the tears of pain that would force their way up.</p>

<p>Then there followed a busy, sad, painful time,
when, between them all, they got the two injured
ones to bed, and attended to their hurts. Geoffrey&#8217;s
shoulder was not fractured, but it was dislocated, and
he had strained and bruised both arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had fallen backwards,&#8221; said Dr. Carlyon
gravely, &#8220;instead of forwards, you would probably
have dislocated your neck. How could you run yourself
and your sisters into such a danger? It was most
culpable of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seemed all right,&#8221; groaned poor Geoffrey, &#8220;and
I don&#8217;t know now why we fell. The branch was a
strong one&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but the rope was not, and you put it up
loosely, so that it rubbed every time you swung, and,
of course, rubbed through in a very little while. You
shall see the frayed ends when you are well enough;
perhaps it will help to teach you how a swing should
not be hung.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Priscilla had a fractured arm and a cut head,
and was badly bruised all over; and when, poor child,
she awoke from her unconsciousness, she found herself
one big block of pain from head to heels, or so it
seemed to her. But worst of all, perhaps, was the
dreadful pain in her head from the blow, and the
jerk, and the shock. She could not endure a ray of
light, nor a sound, nor to speak or be spoken to.</p>

<p>Poor Loveday crept into the bedroom time after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
time to be near her. She brought her best books and
her favourite toys, her paint-box, and even her pink
parasol to lend, or to give to Priscilla, if by doing so
Priscilla could only be got to look better and to take
some interest in things. But Priscilla lay very still
and white, moaning occasionally, and did not look
at Loveday or her treasures, or seem able to take any
interest in anything, and poor little Loveday crept
away again, feeling perfectly miserable, and at her
wits&#8217; end, for if those things failed, she really did
not know what could be done. And if she went to
Geoffrey she only felt more miserable, for he was so
remorseful and unhappy, and kept on saying such
dreadful things about himself for having caused it all,
that one could not dare ask him to play, or even to
read aloud, or to do anything.</p>

<p>At last Loveday grew to look so ill and moped,
that her father and mother decided it would be better
for her to go away for a little while to more cheerful
surroundings, or she would be ill too. But then came
the question: &#8220;Where could she go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Granny would have her, and be delighted to,&#8221;
said Mrs. Carlyon, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t know how to get her
up there. I couldn&#8217;t possibly travel up and back all
in one day, and I should not like to be longer away
from home just now. Nor can you be spared either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I would like her to have sea air,&#8221; said
Dr. Carlyon. &#8220;I think it would be much better
for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I would like her to be where she could have
a child or so to play with,&#8221; added Mrs. Carlyon.</p>

<p>So it seemed they had to find a place for Loveday<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
with children, not very far from home, but by the
sea. It was Nurse who settled the difficulty at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you wouldn&#8217;t like to send her to Bessie,
down at Porthcallis, sir, would you? She&#8217;s got a nice
little cottage, and close to as nice a bit of safe, sandy
beach as you could find anywhere, made on purpose
for children, I should think, and her own little boy
must be nearly as old as Miss Loveday. Bessie does
understand children too, and she is very fond of Miss
Loveday.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was one of Nurse&#8217;s great anxieties. She could
not bear the idea of her &#8220;baby&#8221; being sent away; but
if it was better for her that she should&mdash;and Nurse
saw that it was&mdash;she was anxious that she should go
to some one who loved her and would make her
happy.</p>

<p>Bessie Lobb had been a housemaid for a few years
with Dr. and Mrs. Carlyon when Geoffrey and Priscilla
were babies. She had left to get married before
Loveday was born, but she had been back several
times to Trelint to visit her relations, and had always
come several times to see her former master and
mistress, and children, and Nurse.</p>

<p>Every one hailed Nurse&#8217;s suggestion with joy, for
Porthcallis was only about fifteen miles from Trelint.
The beach was, as Nurse said, very safe, the air was
beautiful; and Bessie was a good, kind, trustworthy
body, and her husband was a nice respectable man,
and devoted to children.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carlyon wrote to Bessie at once, and very
quickly a reply came to say that Bessie would be proud
and pleased to have Miss Loveday. She had a spare<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
bedroom that Miss Loveday could have, and she would
do her best to make her comfortable and happy.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is capital,&#8221; said Mrs. Carylon, greatly relieved
that matters were settling themselves so well.
&#8220;I will write to Bessie at once, and say I will bring
Loveday on Thursday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I had better set to work at once to sort
out my toys and begin to pack, I suppose,&#8221; said
Loveday, in a tone of great importance, &#8220;or I am sure
I shall never be ready in time.&#8221;</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />


<small>LOVEDAY GOES VISITING</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">BUT though she began her packing at once,
and went on with it most industriously for
the two following days, yet, when Thursday
morning came, she was not, according to
her own accounts, nearly ready.</p>

<p>There really was a great deal to be done. First of
all she had to find a basket in which to pack her cat,
&#8220;Mrs. Peters,&#8221; and her three kittens, for until that was
done she could not make any other plans or attend to
anything else.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, she found at once a nice
shiny hat-box, with a leather handle and a lock and
key, which would just hold the Peters family, for the
kittens were quite tiny. &#8220;I will pack all my white
flannel petticoats in the bottom of it,&#8221; she said to
herself, &#8220;for they will be nice for Mrs. Peters and the
kittens to lie on, and it will be a good thing to get
the petticoats in out of the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>So in went the petticoats, and then the kittens, but
Mrs. Peters was out, and had to be waited for. She
came in, though, in such good time that she and her
family and the petticoats were packed and locked and
strapped up long before Loveday&#8217;s dinner-time came;
and what would have been the end of the poor kittens<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
and their mother if their own dinner-time had not come
very soon, and Nurse had not come in search of them
to feed them, no one can imagine, for the box had no
ventilation holes, and the lid shut down quite close.</p>

<p>If Mrs. Peters and the kittens suffered, though,
Loveday suffered too; for Nurse was so angry when
she saw the petticoats in the box with the cats, that
she ordered Loveday to sit down and pick off from
them every single hair that the cats had left behind,
and they had left so many that to Loveday it seemed
a marvel that they were not all quite bald. She did
not get rid of quite all the hairs, though, for by tea-time
her eyes were so swelled and smarting with crying,
she was excused the rest, after promising never, never
to do such a thing again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think, dear, that you had better leave
Mrs. Peters and her family behind?&#8221; suggested her
mother, when Loveday, after ransacking the whole
house, had found a basket to take the place of the
hat-box.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no!&#8221; cried Loveday; &#8220;Mrs. Peters would
fret dreadfully for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think she would, dear, now she has her
little ones to interest her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, I am sure she would. You see she would
have no one to talk to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would talk to her,&#8221; said mother, &#8220;and make
much of her,&#8221; and looking rather grave, &#8220;you see there
is a great deal of water at Porthcallis, and the kittens
are so very young. If they escaped from you or their
mother, and got down on the sands and a wave came
in, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>&#8220;Can kittens swim?&#8221; asked Loveday, looking very
anxious.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, dear; such baby things, too, would be too
frightened to do anything. I really think it would be
kinder to leave them at home with Nurse and me, and
Priscilla would be glad, too, to have them to watch
and play with when she gets better. She will be rather
lonely and dull without you, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So she will,&#8221; sighed Loveday, &#8220;but of course I
shall come home at once if Prissy wants me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must breathe in all the sea air you can,
and grow strong and rosy, and you must collect all
the pretty shells you can find, for Priscilla, and then,
perhaps&mdash;but remember it is only <i>perhaps</i>&mdash;when Priscilla
and Geoffrey are well enough we may all come
down to Porthcallis for a holiday with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how lovely!&#8221; cried Loveday, dancing and
clapping her hands with joy. &#8220;I shall like going ever
so much better now than I did.&#8221; She went over and
leaned on her mother, and looked up into her face. &#8220;I&mdash;I
didn&#8217;t want to go before you said that,&#8221; she confided
to her in a half whisper, &#8220;at least not very much;
but I do now, and I will get all the shells I can for
Prissy, and I will get to know my way everywhere so
as to be able to lead you all about when you come.
And now,&#8221; bustling away, &#8220;I am going to take out all
my toys to see which of them I shall pack;&#8221; and off
she ran. In a moment or two, though, she was back
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, don&#8217;t you think I ought to take one of
my toys, or one of Prissy&#8217;s, to Aaron Lobb? I don&#8217;t
expect he has very many, and little boys and girls<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
always like to have something brought to them when
people come on a visit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, certainly, dear. Take one of your own&mdash;something
you think a boy would like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveday thought for a moment. &#8220;I fink I&#8217;ll take
him the big monkey. It is very ugly, but boys like
ugly things;&#8221; and off she ran again, and this time
really reached the nursery, where Mrs. Peters and her
family were frantically clawing at the basket in their
longing to get outside it.</p>

<p>Loveday untied the lid and let them all out.
&#8220;You are not to go after all,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I hope
you won&#8217;t be dis&#8217;pointed, but mother finks Prissy
may want you, and, after all, the fish at Porthcallis
isn&#8217;t better than any other, and there&#8217;s a <i>dreadful</i> lot
of water.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whether Mrs. Peters understood the change of
plan or not, who can say? But it is a fact that she
lay down purring with happiness, and, drawing all her
children about her, talked to them for a long time.</p>

<p>Three days later, about noon, Loveday and Mrs.
Carlyon started. It was not a very long journey by
train&mdash;an engine soon covers fifteen miles; and the
afternoon sun was still shining bright and hot when
they stepped out on the platform of the little bare
country station, which was not very far from Mrs.
Lobb&#8217;s cottage. Though one could not actually
see the sea from the platform, one felt that it was
close by, for one could smell it in the air, and on
stormy days one could hear it; and, though I don&#8217;t
know how it came there, there certainly was sea-sand
all about the platform, which made it look and feel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
as though the sea certainly must reach that far sometimes.</p>

<p>It was all very open and breezy, and there seemed
to be an endless amount of air and space, and sea and
sand, and sky and everything. Loveday almost wished
there was not quite so much; it made her feel so
small, and rather forlorn. But she had not much
time to think about it, for things kept on happening.
There were no omnibuses or cabs or anything to take
them anywhere.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are we going to get my box to Bessie&#8217;s
house?&#8221; she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>A man with a wheelbarrow had come up, and was
standing by them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take the box, little lady,&#8221; he said, touching
his hat and smiling at her. &#8220;For the rest, hereabouts,
we mostly goes on Shanks&#8217;s mare.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you,&#8221; said Loveday.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carlyon explained to the man where she
wanted him to take the box, and paid him; and when
he had gone, and she had gathered up the little things
she wished to carry herself, she and Loveday started
to follow. Outside the station, Loveday stopped and
looked about her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along, darling,&#8221; said mother rather impatiently.
&#8220;What are you looking for? This is the
way. I want to go to one or two shops first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was looking for Shanks and his mare,&#8221; she
explained, &#8220;to take us to Bessie&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_f064.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;<span class="smcap">&#8216;I&#8217;ll take Thomas,&#8217; she said.</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the station-master need have
laughed like that,&#8221; she said indignantly, as, a moment
later, they walked quickly away. &#8220;Everybody makes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
mistakes, and we don&#8217;t call legs by such silly names at
home, and&mdash;and one <i>can&#8217;t</i> know <i>everything</i>. Even
grown-ups don&#8217;t know everything, but they do laugh
at such silly things. <i>I</i> don&#8217;t see anything funny in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t suppose you do, dear. But look!
here is a fine shop,&#8221; said Mrs. Carlyon, drawing up
before a window full of toys, and china, and a few
books, and some boxes of chocolates, and a long string
of tin buckets all painted different colours. &#8220;We will
go in, shall we? I want to get you a spade and bucket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you!&#8221; gasped Loveday. &#8220;How
lovely!&#8221; and she forgot in a moment all her troubles
and the trying habit grown-ups have of laughing at
nothing.</p>

<p>Some of the buckets had names painted on their
sides.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you one with &#8216;Loveday&#8217; on it?&#8221; she
asked eagerly of the woman who came out to serve
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, miss,&#8221; said the woman, shaking her head.
&#8220;I never heard of no such name as that before.
I&#8217;ve got one with &#8216;Thomas&#8217; on it, and &#8216;Ada,&#8217; and
&#8216;Susan.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveday hesitated a moment; then, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take
&#8216;Thomas,&#8217;&#8221; she said. &#8220;You see,&#8221; she explained to
her mother when they got outside, &#8220;if I had chosen
&#8216;Ada&#8217; or &#8216;Susan,&#8217; people would have thought it was
my own real name, but they can&#8217;t think I am called
&#8216;Thomas.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose people have much time for thinking
about little girls and the names on their buckets,&#8221;
said Mrs. Carlyon quietly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>&#8220;No, not people, mummy, but boys and girls
have. They have lots of time, and they notice
everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Armed with her spade and her scarlet bucket,
Loveday walked on quite cheerfully to Bessie&#8217;s house.
From the station it had looked quite close, only just
across a green, and along a strip of level road and
a little bit of beach, and there you were. But the
country just there was flat and deceptive; the road
wound and curved, and they found it quite a longish
walk by the time they had passed the green and
followed the windings of the road, and crossed the
stretch of sands. But there they were at last, and
there was Bessie out to welcome them, and Aaron,
too, though he disappeared behind his mother&#8217;s skirts
as soon as the strangers came really close.</p>

<p>Loveday thought him a very funny little boy, and
not at all pretty. He had very round red cheeks, and
a snub nose, and big dark eyes; his hair was dark, too,
and quite straight, and cut very close to his head.
Loveday looked at him with the greatest interest and
curiosity. He was very different from what she had
expected; for one thing, he was older and more manly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is like a boy, not a baby,&#8221; she said to herself,
and felt a little disappointed.</p>

<p>She had thought she was to have had a play-fellow
whom she could have &#8220;mothered&#8221; and managed
a little. But she soon found out her mistake. Aaron
Lobb was not at all a baby, nor did he think himself
one or allow others to do so. He was a sturdy little
fellow, and full of a knowledge of the sea and the
tides, and boats, and shells, and fishing, which to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
Loveday seemed simply amazing, and clever beyond
words.</p>

<p>When they had all talked a little, Bessie led the
way into the house, and Loveday thought it was the
most interesting, funny, and charming house she had
ever seen in her life. It stood back from the beach,
close under the towering cliff, and was a long low
house, only one storey high, with big windows, and
a porch over the door, and a verandah on each side of
the door, and it was painted white, all but the window-frames
and the doors, and they were green.</p>

<p>Bessie explained that it had been built by a gentleman
who lived in a big house on the top of the cliff.
He had had it built years ago for his boatman to live
in, &#8220;and there is the path he had made for the man
to go up and down by to the big house.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveday looked, and saw a dear little winding path
going up and up, with here and there a flight of little
steps where the cliff was particularly steep, and all the
way there was a strong hand-rail to prevent one&#8217;s
falling over.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does your husband take charge of the boats for
the gentleman now?&#8221; asked Mrs. Carlyon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said Bessie, shaking her head
and looking very grave. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t keep one now,
poor gentleman! His only son was drowned one day
out there, right in front of his windows, and Mr.
Winter&mdash;he&mdash;he saw it, and&mdash;and it pretty nearly
drove him out of his mind. The next day he sent
down to Button&mdash;Button was his man&mdash;and ordered
every boat to be broke up, and he got rid of Button&mdash;not
&#8217;cause &#8217;twas his fault, but &#8217;cause he couldn&#8217;t abide<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
the sight of anything that had to do with that dreadful
day. He was going to have this little place pulled
down too, but my husband begged and prayed him
not to, houses here being so scarce there&#8217;s no getting
one. And Mr. Winter, he gave in. You see, ma&#8217;am,
he&#8217;d had the little place built low like this, and right
back under the cliff, so&#8217;s it shouldn&#8217;t be seen from the
house, so he was never worried by the sight of it, and
after the accident he wouldn&#8217;t be likely to, for he had
the blinds on that side of the house that faced the sea
drawn down, and he dared anybody ever to raise them
again in his lifetime.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveday was very much impressed by this sad
story. She seemed to see the poor father sitting
lonely and sad in his dark house, while his only son
lay for ever at the bottom of the cruel sea, which
stretched before his very eyes. There were tears in
Mrs. Carlyon&#8217;s eyes as she listened, and quite a sadness
lay for the moment over the whole scene as they
followed Bessie into the bungalow. It was quite a
large bungalow, and so well built and nicely finished
inside. On one side of the little entrance was a cosy,
spotlessly clean kitchen-parlour, with scullery behind
it, and beyond that was Bessie&#8217;s bedroom; both had
windows looking out to sea, and Bessie&#8217;s room had a
little door at the end, by which she could get in and
out without having to go through the kitchen. On
the other side of the entrance was a nice little room,
which had been built, said Bessie, for the young
gentleman and his friends to have a meal in, or sit
in, and behind it were two little rooms which had
been built for dressing-rooms or bedrooms, for him to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
change in if he came home wet, or to sleep in if he was
going to start very early on a fishing expedition, or
come home late.</p>

<p>The front room, which looked out to sea, Bessie
had made her parlour, while the others were two dear
little bedrooms, one of which was now Aaron&#8217;s, while
the other was to be Loveday&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Loveday&#8217;s eyes sparkled when she saw hers. It
had a wooden bed in it&mdash;such a curious-looking one,
for it had been a four-poster, but, as it wouldn&#8217;t go
into any room in the bungalow, they had had to cut
the top off, so that now it seemed to have two sets of
legs, the four it stood on and four that stood up in the
air. The window was hung with curtains of blossom-white
muslin, and the looking-glass and dressing-table
and bed were all hung with the same. So snowy and
soft and billowy it looked, the little room might almost
have been filled with white clouds or foam. The
woodwork was painted white, and the walls were white
too, but for a frieze around the top, whereon white-sailed
ships scudded along over a glorious blue-green
sea, while gulls hovered and swooped, or stood stiffly
on the bright green grass on the cliff-top.</p>

<p>Loveday was enchanted. &#8220;Oh, I wish Prissy could
see it too!&#8221; she cried, and that was the only flaw in
her great delight.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />


<small>PISKIES STILL LIVE AT PORTHCALLIS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PRESENTLY though, just for a time another
shadow fell, for it seemed only a very, very
little while before it was time for her mother
to leave.</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>wish</i> you could stay all the time,
mother,&#8221; she whispered eagerly. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you,
mother? It would do you good too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, darling, think of poor Priscilla. She will
be wanting me, and I know you wouldn&#8217;t like to keep
me away from her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveday was not quite sure of that at the moment,
but she would not have said so; and when she thought
of pale, suffering Prissy, she tried hard to choke down
any selfish feeling, and to be very brave. &#8220;But&mdash;you
will come again soon, won&#8217;t you, mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, darling, very soon; and I expect father will
run down to see you in a very little while, and we
will always let you know if any of us are coming, so that
you can come to meet us. Now, are you going to see
me off at the station, or will you stay here and wave
your handkerchief to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please, I&#8217;ll go to the station.&#8221;</p>

<p>They all had tea on the beach outside the cottage,
and when that was done it was almost time for Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
Carlyon to start on her homeward journey. Bessie
was to go to the station too, and take Aaron with
her; and Mrs. Carlyon felt pretty sure that by the
time Loveday had had the double walk, she would be
too tired to fret much, or feel lonely, or to do anything
but go to bed and sleep.</p>

<p>She was a very brave little woman, on the whole,
considering that she was alone in a strange place, and
with people who were almost strangers to her. A
few tears did force themselves through her lids, but
she did not say anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you get back, darling, you must help
Bessie to unpack your box, and you will be able to
give Aaron his monkey, then you will be ready for
bed, and when you wake up again it will be morning,
and you will feel so happy, and there will be so much
to see and do, that you will scarcely know what to
see and do first. But don&#8217;t forget to collect a nice
lot of shells for Priscilla.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the engine gave two or three snorts and
puffs, and a loud whistle&mdash;away moved the train,
and Loveday found herself left alone.</p>

<p>She might have shed a few tears more when the
train puffed away&mdash;in fact, it is pretty certain that
she would have if she had not, at that moment, caught
sight of the station-master, and remembered his rude
laughter about Shanks&#8217;s mare. He had not caught sight
of her yet, and Loveday was anxious to hurry away
before he did, and in her eagerness and hurry she
quite forgot about her tears and her loneliness; and
then it was such fun to watch the ducks and geese on
the green, and to make them run at one, and stretch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
their necks and scream, that she was soon laughing
instead of crying; and when they got back there was
a boat drawn up on the beach, and that was very
exciting, for Mr. Lobb had come back with a big
catch of crabs and lobsters, and Loveday, after being
introduced to him, was for quite a long while perfectly
fascinated, watching the creatures trying to get out
of the great lumbering crab-pots which he had brought
them home in.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish now, missie, as yer ma hadn&#8217;t a-been
gone, for she could have took home two or three of
these, and welcome to &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I wish she hadn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Loveday earnestly.
&#8220;Father loves lobsters and crabs; he would have
been so glad&mdash;so would Geoffrey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, look here now,&#8221; said John Lobb good-naturedly.
&#8220;Bessie&#8217;ll bile these presently, and then
if she&#8217;ll pop one or two into a basket, I&#8217;ll take them
up and post &#8217;em, and your pa&#8217;ll have &#8217;em in time for
his breakfast in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>At which Loveday was full of gratitude, and
thanked her new host very heartily and prettily.</p>

<p>So Bessie hurried in to attend to her fire, and as
a cold wind was blowing in from the sea, she bade
the children follow her.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_f072.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;<span class="smcap">A big catch of crabs and lobsters.</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;ll unpack my box,&#8221; thought Loveday, and,
Bessie having unstrapped and unlocked it for her, she
began. There was a little white chest of drawers in
the room, and a big cupboard built into the wall, so
that she had plenty of room for her belongings. Her
little frocks, though she had quite a lot of them, took
up a very small space indeed, but two of her sun-hats<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
covered one shelf of the cupboard, and she had to
take another shelf for her best one and her red and
blue <i>b&eacute;rets</i>. Her boots and shoes she arranged very
neatly at the bottom of the cupboard&mdash;at least Aaron
did for her, for by this time he had followed her in,
and had grown quite friendly, and he worked really
busily until Loveday took out a big monkey and presented
it to him, after which he did nothing but gaze
at it and hug it with delight, and Loveday, who had
been a little shy of offering it to him when she saw
how big a boy he was, felt greatly relieved on seeing
his pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; she said to herself, &#8220;he isn&#8217;t such a
very big boy&mdash;he is <i>rather</i> a baby, and I am very glad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Bessie came to call them to supper, and soon
after that Loveday, holding tight to her elephant, was
sound asleep in her snow-white room; and Aaron, still
hugging his monkey, was snoring contentedly under his
gay patchwork quilt.</p>

<p>&#8220;A rare lot of wild beasts we&#8217;ve a-got in our little
bit of a place to-night,&#8221; said John Lobb, with a hearty
laugh. &#8220;&#8217;Tis lucky they b&#8217;ain&#8217;t given to bellowing,
or we should be given notice to quit, I reckon!&#8221;</p>

<p>When Loveday awoke the next morning, the first
thing she noticed was the curious dull roar of the sea.
Then she opened her eyes and looked about her. The
next moment she was out of bed, drawing back her
white curtains to look out at the new, wonderful
world without. There was little to see, though, from
her window, for the cliff rose sheer up, and between
the house and the cliff there was only a little bit of
fenced-in ground. It was too close under the shadow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
of the cold rock for anything to grow in it, and the
house, though it kept off the wind and the salt spray,
also kept off the sun. To make up for this, John Lobb
had a piece of garden ground at the top of the cliff,
where he worked when he wasn&#8217;t out fishing.</p>

<p>But when Loveday looked out he was in the yard
at the back, examining the nets that were spread on
the palings to dry. A moment later, Aaron, still
clasping his monkey, ran out and joined his father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Aaron is dressed!&#8221; thought Loveday. &#8220;I
ought to be. Why didn&#8217;t Bessie call me?&#8221;</p>

<p>She put her head out of her bedroom door, and
called:</p>

<p>&#8220;Bessie! Bessie! Please can I have my bath!
I am sorry I am so late,&#8221; she added, as Bessie appeared
with the bath and the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t late, Miss Loveday,&#8221; said Bessie smilingly.
&#8220;It has only this minute gone seven by my old clock,
and that&#8217;s always galloping.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only seven!&#8221; cried Loveday. &#8220;What are you
all up so early for? Is anybody going away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tisn&#8217;t early for us, miss. My husband is
going out all day fishing, and he&#8217;s got to catch the
tide.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is always something that has got to be
caught,&#8221; sighed Loveday&mdash;&#8220;the train, or the tide, or
the fish, or the post. But I&#8217;m very glad I am up so
early, now I am up. I want to go out and see what
things are like in the morning. They generally look
different then, don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear,&#8221; she said quite apologetically, when
presently she came to the breakfast-table, &#8220;I am<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
afraid I am <i>very</i> hungry. I hope you won&#8217;t be
frightened when you see what a lot I eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>She really felt quite ashamed of her big appetite,
but John and Bessie only laughed, and John said:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good hearing, missie. Nothing you can
do in that way&#8217;ll frighten us, seeing as we&#8217;m &#8217;customed
to Aaron and me.&#8221;</p>

<p>John sat at the head of the table, nearest the fireplace,
while Bessie sat outside, where she could easily
reach the kettle or the teapot on the stove. Loveday&#8217;s
chair was placed at the end, facing John, while the
table was pulled out a little way for Aaron to sit in the
window amongst the geraniums and cinerarias. In her
heart Loveday wished that she could sit in there, but
at the same time she was rather pleased with her own
position; it seemed older and more dignified.</p>

<p>After breakfast there came the excitement of seeing
off the boat, and then, when that was done, Loveday
felt that she really could settle down for a moment
and have time to look about her. Aaron was very
anxious to see her toys and all the other treasures she
had brought with her, for this was a much greater
novelty to him than picking up shells or hunting for
crabs, besides which Bessie would not let them go
alone clambering over the rocks, or paddling in the
pools, and she could not go with them for a little while,
as she had her house to set straight and the dinner
to get.</p>

<p>So they sat on the sands within sight of Bessie, and
played with a grocer&#8217;s shop that Loveday had brought,
and a box of cubes, and a popgun, and a monkey and
an elephant, and sundry other things, but to her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
surprise none of the things pleased Aaron so much
as did the books. He turned the pages of her fairy-tales
over and over, and gazed at the pictures, and
asked questions about them, until at last Loveday
grew quite tired of answering him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you got any books?&#8221; she asked at last
rather impatiently, for she would have been much
better pleased to have had his help in building sand-castles.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I have never had a book in all my life,&#8221; he
said wistfully. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know there was any with
picshers in them like these here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; cried Loveday, scarcely able to
believe him. &#8220;I wish I&#8217;d known it; I&#8217;d have brought
you one of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I knows some stories,&#8221; he said proudly&mdash;&#8220;lots!
All &#8217;bout piskies, and fairies, and giants, and
buccas, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are buccas?&#8221; interrupted Loveday
eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why, little people, of course,&#8221; said Aaron.</p>

<p>Loveday looked at him to see if he was &#8220;telling
true&#8221; or laughing at her, but Aaron was quite serious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you telling truth or making up?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>It was a question she was often obliged to put to
Geoffrey and Priscilla when they told her things.</p>

<p>&#8220;True, honour bright,&#8221; said Aaron earnestly, just
a little indignant. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you ever read about buccas
in your books?&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveday shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they fairies?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>&#8220;Good ones or bad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good, I b&#8217;lieve,&#8221; said Aaron. &#8220;I never heard
of their doing anybody any harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever seen one?&#8221; asked Loveday, in a
lowered voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Aaron; &#8220;they lives in caves and wells,
mostly&mdash;so father says&mdash;and they&#8217;m always digging.
You ask father to tell &#8217;ee about them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you tell me. I want to hear about them
now. Go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if I tell you one story, you must tell me
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Loveday; &#8220;go on. It must be
about buccas, &#8217;cause I never heard about them before,
and&mdash;and I don&#8217;t think there are any.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, hush! Don&#8217;t &#8217;ee say such things!&#8221; cried
Aaron, quite scared. &#8220;You&#8217;d be sorry if you was to
get Barker&#8217;s knee, and you will most likely, if you say
things like that. They do all sorts of things to folks
that &#8217;fend them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveday felt rather frightened, but she would not
let Aaron know it if she could help it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you said they were good fairies,&#8221; she
said half irritably.</p>

<p>&#8220;So they are, but fairies never likes folks to say
they don&#8217;t believe in &#8217;em. That was how Barker got
his bad knee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on&mdash;tell,&#8221; said Loveday.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, &#8217;twas like this: Barker, he was a great
lazy fellow what wouldn&#8217;t work nor nothing, and he
laughed at those that did; and when his father said
to him that the buccas put him to shame, he said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
there wasn&#8217;t any, and he said he&#8217;d prove it: he&#8217;d go
to the well where folks said they lived, and where they
could hear them working, and he&#8217;d listen, and he&#8217;d
listen, and if he heard them he&#8217;d believe in them, but
not else. So he went to the well every day, and lay
down in the grass close by all day long. And he heard
the little buccas as plain as plain; they was digging
and shovelling and laughing and talking all the time.
But Barker, he wouldn&#8217;t tell anybody that he&#8217;d heard
them, and he went every day and lay down by the
well to listen to them, and soon he got to understand
their talk, and how long they worked; and when they
stopped working they hid away their tools, but they
always told where they was going to hide them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was silly!&#8221; said Loveday. &#8220;There&#8217;s no
sense in doing that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hoosh!&#8221; said Aaron nervously; &#8220;you&#8217;d best be
careful what you&#8217;m saying. One night Barker heard
one little bucca say, &#8216;I&#8217;m going to hide my pick under
the ferns.&#8217; &#8216;I shan&#8217;t,&#8217; says another; &#8216;I shall leave
mine on Barker&#8217;s knee.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; gasped Loveday, &#8220;then they knew his
name. Did they know all the time that he was there
listening to them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon so,&#8221; said Aaron gravely. &#8220;Little people
knows everything mostly; that&#8217;s why you&#8217;ve got to
be so careful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; said Loveday eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Barker, he was prettily frightened when
he heard that, and he was just going to jump up and
run away, when whump! something hit him right on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
the knee like anything, and oh!&#8221; groaned Aaron, his
eyes big and round with the excitement of his story,
&#8220;it &#8217;urt him so he bellowed like a great bull, and he
kept on saying, &#8216;Take &#8217;em away; take them there
tools away; take your old pick and shovel off my
knee, I tell &#8217;e!&#8217; But the little buccas only laughed,
and the more he bellowed, the more they laughed.
He tried to get up, but &#8217;twas ever so long before
he could, and he had a stiff knee all the rest of his
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did people know why?&#8221; asked Loveday.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that they did, and everybody was fine and
careful after not to laugh at the buccas, for fear
they&#8217;d get Barker&#8217;s knee too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Loveday, &#8220;I like the piskies best&mdash;I
mean, of course, I like the buccas too, but I love
the piskies &#8217;cause they come and do nice things to
help people, and I love the fairies &#8217;cause they are so
pretty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a fairy ring up top cliff,&#8221; said Aaron,
&#8220;where they comes and dances night-times. I&#8217;ll
show it to you some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do!&#8221; cried Loveday. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got one near
home, too, but I&#8217;ve never seen any fairies near it&mdash;have
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but I haven&#8217;t been out at night, and that&#8217;s
when they come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along, dears; I am ready now,&#8221; said
Bessie, appearing at the door. &#8220;Come in and have
a glass of milk and some cake, and then we&#8217;ll go and
look for crabs and things, shall we?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>Loveday and Aaron were on their feet in a
moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must get my bucket and spade if we are going
to get crabs and shells,&#8221; said Loveday, and dashed
into the house, leaving all her toys scattered on the
sand.</p>

<small>MISS POTTS COMES TO TEA</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap3">LOVEDAY had been gone more than a week,
Geoffrey was nearly well again, and Priscilla
was on the mend&mdash;the dreadful pain in her
head had almost left her, so had her other
aches and bruises, but the broken arm
bothered her a good deal, and she was very weak
and languid, so that it was still necessary that she
should be kept very quiet and not be allowed to
exert herself.</p>

<p>She had reached the stage, though, when it becomes
tiresome to keep still; when one wants to
do things, yet feels one can&#8217;t; or others want one
to do things, and one feels one cannot possibly do
them, and altogether one is cross and teasy without
knowing why.</p>

<p>To read made her head ache, and it was tiresome
to hold up a book with only one hand, and to have
none to turn the pages with; neither could she very
well play with her dolls, or her bricks, or anything
with but one hand. Her mother read to her sometimes,
and talked to her; but, of course, she could
not do so all the time, and Priscilla would have grown
tired even if she could.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; she said one day, after every one had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
tried to think of something to amuse her, &#8220;I know
what I would like very, very much indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, dear, tell me what it is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would like to ask Miss Potts to come and see
me. I like her <i>so</i> much, and I think she must miss
me, because I often went in to talk to her to cheer her
up after I knew she was an &#8216;only&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, darling; I am going out presently,
and I will ask her. I don&#8217;t quite know, though, how
she could manage to leave her shop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it would matter much if she did&mdash;not
if she came while the children are in school,
&#8217;cause there isn&#8217;t any one else to go and buy much&mdash;except
on Saturdays.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see. Well, I will go and talk to her about it,
and see what she has to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla had always felt drawn to Miss Potts, the
quiet, lonely woman who lived in a world of toys now,
yet looked as though she had never been a child or
played with any; and ever since Miss Potts had told
her she was alone in the world, Priscilla had had quite
a motherly feeling for her. She felt quite excited and
pleased at the prospect of her visitor.</p>

<p>She was so pleased, that she did not know how to
wait until her mother came back with the answer to her
message; and then she wished, oh so much, that she
had asked if Miss Potts should be invited to tea with
her. Never mind, she decided, she would ask mother
that when she came back with her news. This thought
comforted and soothed her so much that she was
able to lie still more contentedly, and wait, and
while she was waiting, her thoughts flew to Loveday.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
She tried to picture what she would be doing at that
moment. Loveday was not, of course, able to write
much, for she was very young, and she had only just
begun to write real letters; but Bessie had written
a good deal about her and Aaron, and the fun they
had; and mother had told her all she possibly could
about the place, and the house, and the sea, and shops,
and the station and everything else she could think
of, and now Priscilla was looking forward to the time
when she and Geoffrey would go down to Porthcallis
and join Loveday.</p>

<p>She was just picturing to herself the journey down,
and Loveday waiting for them on the platform, when
she heard the front door opened and closed again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother must have got back already!&#8221; she cried
joyfully. &#8220;I hope Miss Potts can come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she heard footsteps, and a moment later the
door opened, and in came mother, followed by Miss
Potts herself! Priscilla could scarcely believe her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here she is!&#8221; cried Mrs. Carlyon. &#8220;Here is
your longed-for visitor. I would not let her stay even
to put on her best bonnet, or her mantle, or anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; oh dear, no! I don&#8217;t know what a sight
I am looking, I am sure!&#8221; said Miss Potts nervously.
&#8220;But your dear ma whisked me off, so I&#8217;d no time to
change my frock or do anything but pop on my old
second-best bonnet and shawl. I hope you&#8217;ll excuse
me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Miss Potts chattered on volubly, not because
she really minded much, but because she was shy
and nervous, and sometimes shy and nervous people
feel that they must keep on saying something.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>Priscilla put out her hand to clasp Miss Potts&#8217;s
hand, and then put up her face to be kissed. The
tears came into Miss Potts&#8217;s faded, tired eyes as she
stooped and kissed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you are looking&mdash;oh, ever so nice!&#8221; said
Priscilla warmly. &#8220;I like you in that bonnet better
than any. I think it suits you better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really now, missie?&#8221; said Miss Potts,
evidently relieved and pleased. &#8220;And how are you,
dearie? Are you better?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, thank you,&#8221; said Priscilla&mdash;&#8220;ever so
much! I think I shall be quite well soon, and then
we are going to Porthcallis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear, dear,&#8221; cried Miss Potts, &#8220;that will be nice.
Nobody could help getting well down there in the
sunshine and sea-breezes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you like the sea?&#8221; asked Priscilla. &#8220;Did
you ever stay by it when you were a little girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, I did,&#8221; said Miss Potts. &#8220;I was born
by it, and grew up by it till I was turned twenty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were born by the sea!&#8221; cried Priscilla.
&#8220;Oh, how lovely&mdash;and I never knew it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Potts at once became more interesting than
ever. Priscilla tried to picture her digging in the
sands and wading through the pools.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how could you bear to come away?&#8221; she
cried. &#8220;I am sure I should never leave the sea if I
could help it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, my dear, it all depends!&#8221; said Miss Potts,
with a sad shake of the head. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t set eyes on
the sea since I left it, and I&mdash;I hope I never do again.
I couldn&#8217;t bear it, even now.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>&#8220;Oh, how sad!&#8221; said Priscilla, looking at her with
wide eyes full of sympathetic interest. &#8220;Did your
little brothers and sisters live there too?&#8221; she asked
gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, missie, and died there,&#8221; said Miss Potts
sadly. &#8220;Every one of us but mother and me; that&#8217;s
why I&#8217;ve never looked on it since. To me it is like
a great, sly, deceitful monster, always sighing and
moaning for somebody, or foaming and storming in
rage. We came away, mother and me, after the last
was drowned; we couldn&#8217;t bear it any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Miss Potts!&#8221; said little Priscilla, laying her
hand on Miss Potts&#8217;s worn ones, moving so restlessly
in her lap.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carlyon had gone away and left them together,
and Miss Potts had dropped into a chair close to
Priscilla&#8217;s sofa.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think the sea will roar for Loveday,
and swallow her up, do you?&#8221; asked Priscilla, in a very
anxious voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, my dear; Porthcallis is a very safe
place!&#8221; said Miss Potts emphatically. &#8220;P&#8217;r&#8217;aps I
shouldn&#8217;t have told you anything about&mdash;about my
experience. But where we lived it was very wild and
rocky, and my folk were all seafaring; &#8217;twas their work
to go to sea. Out of all my family that lies in the
burying-ground, only two of them are men; all the
rest of our men-folk lies at the bottom of the sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you had sisters, hadn&#8217;t you, Miss Potts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear, two; but the sea had them as well.
One of them, Annie&mdash;she was the youngest&mdash;was out
shrimping by herself one day, when the tide caught<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
her and carried her out. Hettie saw her, and ran into
the sea to save her, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; whispered Priscilla softly, her eyes full
of tears. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t she reach her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, she reached her. Father, coming home
that night from the fishing, found them clasped
together, and brought them home,&#8221; said poor Miss
Potts. &#8220;I never saw a smile on his face from that
day till just a year later, when the sea claimed
him too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how dreadful! I shall never like the sea
again,&#8221; said Priscilla, wiping away her tears. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
wonder you came away. Did you come straight to
Trelint?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Miss Potts more cheerfully; &#8220;and I
felt at home here at once. I shouldn&#8217;t care to live
anywhere else now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither should I,&#8221; said Priscilla. &#8220;I love home,
and Trelint, and&mdash;oh, everything; and I would rather
live here than by the sea, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Carlyon opened the door, and put her head in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alma is going to bring you some tea presently,&#8221;
she said brightly. &#8220;Miss Potts said she could stay
and have some with you. I am sorry to say I have
to go out, but I know you will take care of each other.
Good-bye, darling, for the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla beamed with pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just what I was wanting. I am so glad
you can stay, Miss Potts. I don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose any one will
go to the shop, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not for a moment mean to be rude or
unkind.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>&#8220;No, I expect not,&#8221; said Miss Potts a little sadly.</p>

<p>But in a moment or two the door opened again,
and in walked Geoffrey. At sight of Miss Potts he
drew up, and stepped back towards the door as though
thunderstruck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; he cried, in a hollow, melodramatic voice,
&#8220;here she is! False woman, I have found you. For
ten minutes and more have I been kicking your door
with my noble toes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Potts groaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the paint but just dry!&#8221; she murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;But no answer could I get,&#8221; went on Geoffrey,
&#8220;and at last&#8221;&mdash;lowering his voice and continuing in
a tragic whisper&mdash;&#8220;at last I dropped my ha&#8217;penny
back into my pocket and came away. &#8216;I must lay
it out elsewhere,&#8217; I moaned. But when I reached Ma
Tickell&#8217;s shop, Pa Tickell was behind the door, and
in his eye I read that he was going to request me to
say my &#8216;twelve times&#8217; backwards, and I knew he would
not believe that my illness alone had made me forget
it, so I crossed over and gazed in sadly at Ma Wall&#8217;s,
but Ma Wall looked at me so scornfully that I came
home; and here I find you gossip, gossip, gossip, and
my ha&#8217;penny burning a hole in my pocket all the time.
You know, Miss Potts, it is not the way to do
business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Miss Potts, laughing; &#8220;but if you
can tell me what you wanted particularly I&#8217;ll send
it up as soon as I get home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Geoffrey solemnly; &#8220;I must
see things before I can lay out my money to the best
advantage.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>&#8220;Well, I promise not to be very long, Master
Geoffrey, and then you shall go back with me, if you
will, and choose what you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this nice little parcel?&#8221; asked Geoffrey,
touching one that had been lying on the table ever
since Miss Potts came in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; cried Miss Potts, jumping up with a little
scream&mdash;&#8220;oh, how foolish of me! Why, that&#8217;s something
I brought for Miss Priscilla, if she&#8217;ll accept it;
and with talking so much, and being so glad to see
her, it had clean gone out of my head;&#8221; and she
placed the nice-looking little parcel in Priscilla&#8217;s
hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; exclaimed Geoffrey, pretending to be
deeply hurt, &#8220;I think you might have thought of my
feelings, and waited till I had gone away. I felt
certain it was for me, and now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Miss Potts looked quite troubled, but Priscilla&#8217;s
joyful cry rang out before she could speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how lovely! Oh, you dear, kind Miss Potts!
Look, Geoffrey; we can both use it. Isn&#8217;t it lovely?&#8221;
and Priscilla held out a box of paints, just such another
as they had bought for Loveday. &#8220;And they are
<i>sans poison</i>, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; cried Geoffrey. &#8220;Now I&#8217;ll be able to
paint for you while you look on. Miss Potts, you <i>are</i>
a dear; you understand a fellow&#8217;s feelings before he
understands them himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla leaned up to kiss her thanks.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder how you always know exactly what
people want?&#8221; she said gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;P&#8217;r&#8217;aps it&#8217;s through my having a pretty good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
memory,&#8221; said Miss Potts, flushing and smiling with
pleasure. &#8220;I seem able to remember what I used to
think I&#8217;d like when I was little myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then, were you very glad&mdash;as glad as I am&mdash;when
you got what you&#8217;d been thinking about?&#8221;
asked Priscilla.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never got it, my dear,&#8221; said Miss Potts; &#8220;&#8217;twas
all in my thoughts, and never got beyond. But I had
a fine lot of pleasure that way; &#8217;twas almost as good
as having the things themselves, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, not quite,&#8221; said Priscilla, turning to her
paint-box again.</p>

<p>Then Nurse came in with the tea, and laid it on
a table close to Priscilla&#8217;s sofa. Miss Potts seemed
rather nervous and fluttery at having tea there with
the children, but very pleased; and Nurse smiled on
her, and admired the paint-box, and brought in some
especial cakes, because she remembered Miss Potts
liked them, and everything and everybody was as nice
as nice could be.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful tea that they had&mdash;at least, to
them it seemed so, and Miss Potts often afterwards
spoke of it, and sat and thought about it in the long,
quiet evenings she spent alone in the dark little parlour
behind her shop. They did not hurry over the meal&mdash;in
fact, they lingered so long that Mrs. Carlyon
returned before they had done, and presently the
carriage drove up, bringing back Dr. Carlyon from his
afternoon rounds.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Carlyon stooped over her little daughter
to kiss her, Prissy put her one arm round her mother&#8217;s
neck and drew her face down close. She knew it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
not polite to whisper in company, but she wanted
<i>very</i> much to ask a very, very important question, and
she would have no other opportunity; and as Miss
Potts was talking to Geoffrey, and Nurse was rattling
the tea-things, she thought no one would notice that
she was doing more than return her mother&#8217;s kiss.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carlyon quickly heard the whispered request,
and, going out of the room under the pretence of
removing her hat, soon returned with a thin, large
envelope, which she slipped under Priscilla&#8217;s sofa-pillow.
Then Miss Potts got up to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll excuse me, Mrs. Carlyon, for staying
so long. I didn&#8217;t mean to be more than a minute,
and I&#8217;ve been the best part of two hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went over to Priscilla to say &#8220;Good-bye.&#8221; It
was quite an ordeal to her to make her farewells and
leave the room under the eyes of so many. She wanted
to express her gratitude, but she was afraid of saying
too much; she was also afraid of saying too little and
seeming ungrateful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Miss Priscilla,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&mdash;I hope
you will soon be well and able to run about again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Priscilla politely. She was
rather nervous and excited too, and her eyes were
bright and eager. &#8220;I shall come to see you before I
go to Porthcallis, and&mdash;and here is something I&#8217;ve got
for you, but you mustn&#8217;t look at it until you get home.
It is something to keep you from feeling quite so
lonely when you are in your little parlour by yourself
after the shop is shut.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, missie, I am sure,&#8221; said Miss Potts
gratefully.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>And whether she guessed what was in the packet
no one ever knew, but she seemed very pleased and
overcome. And when the poor lonely woman got
back, as Priscilla said, to her lonely parlour behind the
closed shop, and, opening the envelope, looked on the
three bright faces in the photograph, her tears really
did overflow&mdash;tears of pleasure and gratitude for the
beautiful photograph, but most of all for the kind
thought and affection which had prompted the gift.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear little lady,&#8221; she said, gazing affectionately
at Priscilla&#8217;s eager, serious face and wondering eyes;
&#8220;she&#8217;s got a heart of gold; while as for that dear boy,
why, I love every hair of his head and every tone of his
voice, and the more he tries to tease me the more I
love him, I think; and as for little Miss Loveday, why,
no one could help loving her if one tried to.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE FAIRY RING</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap3">LOVEDAY, meanwhile, was having a most interesting
and beautiful time, and she and Aaron
had become great friends. They had some
little tiffs and quarrels too, of course, but
not very serious ones.</p>

<p>The most serious perhaps was that when they disagreed
about their names, when Loveday was certainly
rather unkind, and Aaron grew angry and was rude.
They were both tired, and very hungry; so hungry that
it seemed as though the dinner hour was delaying on
purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why people think they mustn&#8217;t eat
till the clock strikes so many times,&#8221; said Loveday
crossly; &#8220;I think it would be much more sensible to
eat when you are hungry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to know what time dinner is to be,
or you wouldn&#8217;t know when to put things on to cook.
I should have thought you&#8217;d have known that,&#8221; said
Aaron; and he spoke in a tone that annoyed Loveday
more than anything&mdash;a kind of superior, older tone,
as though he were talking to a baby.</p>

<p>Loveday did not reply, but sat and looked at Aaron
as if in deep thought; her eyes sparkled wickedly,
though. &#8220;I do think,&#8221; she said at last, speaking very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
slowly and distinctly, &#8220;that yours is the ugliest name
I ever heard. I can&#8217;t think how any one could choose
such a name!&#8221;</p>

<p>She was sitting on the sand, her elbow on her knee,
her chin in her hand. Aaron was lying near her, flat
on his back. When he heard her he sat up very
straight, his face quite red with anger. Loveday was
cool and calm, and spoke with a deliberate scorn that
hurt him more than anything else she could have done.</p>

<p>His name was that of his father and grandfather,
and he had been rather proud of it hitherto.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I think it&#8217;s a fine name,&#8221; he stammered; &#8220;so
does everybody but you; and you can&#8217;t say anything,
yours is ugly enough&mdash;it&#8217;s a silly name too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; said Loveday calmly. &#8220;I
think it is a very pretty name, so does everybody; but
of course you don&#8217;t know, you are so young.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; blustered Aaron; &#8220;I know as well as
anybody, and I call it ugly, a silly <i>girl&#8217;s</i> name,&#8221; with
great scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of course, I shouldn&#8217;t be called by a boy&#8217;s
name,&#8221; she retorted scornfully; &#8220;but if I had been
a boy, and they&#8217;d christened me Aaron, why, I&mdash;I
wouldn&#8217;t answer to it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you!&#8221; scoffed Aaron; &#8220;you&#8217;d have
been only too glad to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are so many pretty names too,&#8221; went on
Loveday, ignoring his last remark, and gazing at him
in a musing way. &#8220;Douglas, and Gerald, and Ronald,
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be &#8217;shamed to be called by any of them,
silly things! Just like a girl&#8217;s!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>&#8220;Yes, but they aren&#8217;t&mdash;they&#8217;re for boys; you might
just as well say my name was like a boy&#8217;s&mdash;it is rather
like some.&#8221; Then, after looking at him thoughtfully
for a moment, she added slowly, &#8220;I think I shall call
you &#8216;Adolphus,&#8217; Aaron is so ugly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you do, I won&#8217;t answer,&#8221; cried Aaron, springing
to his feet, really angry now; &#8220;you ain&#8217;t going to call me
out of my name. If you do, I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll call you Jane!&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveday giggled. &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind a bit!&#8221; she said
gaily; &#8220;I am christened that already, and my sister is
called Priscilla Mary, and you are going to be called
Aaron Adolphus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not! I shan&#8217;t speak to you, and I won&#8217;t
answer to it,&#8221; began Aaron, when suddenly his mother&#8217;s
voice called to them across the sands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along, children&mdash;dinner is ready at last!&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveday sprang at once to her feet. &#8220;Come
along, Adolphus,&#8221; she said naughtily. If Aaron had
but laughed, and taken no notice of her teasing,
Loveday would probably have found no fun in it,
and have stopped very soon, but he was very cross
indeed, and sulked over his dinner, and the afternoon
might have been spoilt if Bessie had not been
so good-tempered and kind.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going to change our names,&#8221; said Loveday,
beginning her teasing again as soon as they had
begun to eat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Bessie, &#8220;and what are you to be called
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Aaron is to be called Adolphus, only he
doesn&#8217;t seem to like it, and I am called Jane, and you&mdash;let
me see, I&#8217;ll call you&mdash;&#8221; Loveday thought and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
thought, but could not think of anything that quite
pleased her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t mind what it is,&#8221; said Bessie, &#8220;as
long as you don&#8217;t call me &#8216;Bread and Cheese,&#8217; and
eat me.&#8221; It was an old saying, but a new one to the
children, and they both laughed so much that Aaron
forgot his sulks, and Loveday her teasing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will call you Mother Dutch Cheese,&#8221; laughed
Aaron.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there won&#8217;t be much of me left by to-morrow,&#8221;
said Bessie, pretending to look frightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will call you&mdash;&#8221; began Loveday, speaking very
slowly, for she was trying all the time to think of something
very funny to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; said Bessie, &#8220;if, instead of thinking
what you shall call me, you would like to pay a call
for me this afternoon?&#8221;</p>

<p>The children looked at her, not quite understanding.
Bessie explained:</p>

<p>&#8220;I want Aaron to go up to Mr. Winter&#8217;s with a
message, and I thought you would like to go too,
Miss Loveday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d love to!&#8221; cried Loveday, who had been
longing ever since she came to Porthcallis to go up
the cliff-path to the very top, mounting the little
steps, and holding on by the little rail. &#8220;When shall
we go? Now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Finish your dinner first, and sit still for a bit;
then I will tidy you both, for Mr. Winter&#8217;s housekeeper,
Mrs. Tucker, is a very noticing body.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the meal was over, and Aaron had said grace,
and they had with great difficulty kept quiet for a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
little while, Bessie began to tidy them. Aaron, beyond
having a good wash and his hair brushed, had
only a clean holland tunic put on, but Loveday was
anxious to make more of a toilette.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that I had better put
on this?&#8221; dragging out from the drawer a pretty little
frock of white silk muslin with blue harebells all over it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; said Bessie; &#8220;one of your little cotton
over-alls will be much the best.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveday looked disappointed and doubtful; in her
heart she felt sure that Bessie did not know what was
correct.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if Mr. Winter was to see me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear, you needn&#8217;t trouble about Mr. Winter;
he keeps well out of the way if there is anybody about;
but if he did happen to see you, he wouldn&#8217;t know
whether you&#8217;d got on silk or cotton, or blue or yellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he&#8217;d notice my white silk sash with the
roses on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t, missie. But if he did, he&#8217;d only
think it was very unsuitable for going up and down
cliff-paths; and so it is, too. If you were to slip,
why, you&#8217;d most likely ruin it for ever. Now be a
good little girl, and if you want to please Mr. Winter
or Mrs. Tucker with your looks, you&#8217;ll go in your nice
clean print over-all and sun-hat. You shall wear a
white belt about your waist, for fear you might trip
on your loose frock going up that steep path.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_f096.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;&#8216;<span class="smcap">Don&#8217;t let us look any more.</span>&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveday was not satisfied, but she was so pleased
and excited at the thought of going to the big,
mysterious house where the blinds were always drawn,
and the master was never seen, that she had no room<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
for any other feeling, and they started off in great
good humour.</p>

<p>Aaron was so afraid that Loveday would remember
and call him Adolphus again, that he did all he could
to keep her mind off it, and talked incessantly, telling
her such wonderful tales.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Mrs. Tucker doesn&#8217;t keep us too long,&#8221; said
Aaron, &#8220;I&#8217;ll show you the Fairy Ring, where they
come and dance every night at twelve o&#8217;clock. It is
right on top of the cliff, and not far from Mr. Winter&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will be lovely!&#8221; cried Loveday delightedly.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s sit down for a minute; I&#8217;m tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they sat down on one of the little steps, and
looked down and around and all about them. Already
the cottage seemed ever so far off, and so tiny.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks as if there could be only one little room
in it, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Loveday. &#8220;And oh, how
far away the sea looks, and that little boat! Why, it
is quite a little teeny-tiny thing. Oh, don&#8217;t let&#8217;s look
any more; it makes my head go round so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll sit outside,&#8221; said Aaron; &#8220;it won&#8217;t seem
so bad then.&#8221;</p>

<p>They changed places, but even then Loveday did
not like it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go on,&#8221; she said, &#8220;up where we can&#8217;t see
any of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>So on they went, and at last reached the green
grassy top, and a bit of road which led to the gate of
Mr. Winter&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>Though Loveday had heard about the closed house
and the drawn blinds, it still gave her quite a shock
when she saw it. There was such a look of desolation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
and sadness, and neglect about the whole place. On
the side facing the sea, the flower-beds were overgrown
with weeds and flowers which straggled about
in a wild tangle, clinging together and choking each
other; the drawn blinds were faded, the frames of the
fast-shut windows were cracked, and badly in want of
some coats of paint. A rose-bush, that at one time
must have almost covered the front of the house, had
fallen, perhaps during the storms of the past winter,
and as it fell so it lay, twisted and broken, and choking
the wretched plants which were beneath it.</p>

<p>Loveday felt quite saddened by the sight of it all,
and the story of the poor drowned boy and his heart-broken
father became terribly real to her&mdash;so real that
she longed to be able to do something to comfort the
poor man. &#8220;If only he would open his blinds and
windows, and have his garden tidied up, I&#8217;m sure he
wouldn&#8217;t feel so miserable. I think I should cry all
day long if I lived here,&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>The situation of the house itself seemed almost too
lonely to be borne. There was no other dwelling-place,
or sign of human being, within sight, only a
wide, wide space of bare brown fields on two sides;
the grassy cliff-tops with the sea in the distance on
the third; and on the fourth nothing but the heaving,
calling sea; while the wind, always blowing there, swept
along unchecked, winter or summer, storm or calm,
keeping up an incessant wailing around the house;
and the wail of the wind and the call of the gulls
alone broke the silence.</p>

<p>It was not to be wondered at that a feeling of awe
fell on whomsoever entered that gate. It fell on both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
the children now, and they walked up softly, almost
stealthily, for the sound of their footsteps on the white
pebbles seemed to jar in that sad silence. Aaron led
the way, and Loveday followed, holding fast to his
tunic. She was glad now that she had not worn her
smart frock or sash; for even she, young as she was,
felt that they would have been out of place there and
then.</p>

<p>Aaron led the way to what was presumably the
front door, but a door so bare of paint, so neglected
looking, that Loveday thought it could never be used.
The stones of the steps were green, and the weeds
grew up between them. But in answer to Aaron&#8217;s
knock the door was quickly opened by Mrs. Tucker,
the housekeeper. She looked keenly at Loveday, but
she did not say anything, and when she had taken
the note Aaron had brought, and heard his message,
she went in and closed the door again quite sharply.
But in the moment or so it had been open Loveday
had had time to catch a glimpse of a big stone hall,
and a grandfather&#8217;s clock, which ticked with the
hollow note clocks in empty houses usually have.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tucker looked so glum and unsmiling that
the children were quite glad to get away from her,
and they hurried out of the garden much more quickly
than they entered it.</p>

<p>Once outside, Aaron seemed to lose his awe, and
his spirits returned, but Loveday did not so soon
recover. She felt she wanted to do something for
Mr. Winter to make him feel less sad and uncomfortable,
yet she felt quite helpless, especially since she had
seen Mrs. Tucker. If one had to get past her before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
one could see him, it really seemed as though it never
could be done.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now then for the Fairy Ring,&#8221; said Aaron, as
soon as they got outside.</p>

<p>In their relief at getting away from that grim place,
they both took to their heels and ran over a great
stretch of short grass, burnt brown and slippery by
the hot sun, until they came to a large level space on
almost the edge of the cliff, and there on the brown
coarse turf stood out a large ring of grass, so lush
and rich and green that there must surely have been
some hidden spring which fed it, or the fairies must
indeed have been at work.</p>

<p>&#8220;It keeps green like that &#8217;cause the fairies dance
there,&#8221; said Aaron, with pride and awe.</p>

<p>Loveday jumped carefully over the green ring and
stood in the centre.</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect they&#8217;d be angry if I stepped on it&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t
they?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>They both spoke softly, as though half afraid of
disturbing or offending the &#8220;little people.&#8221; Aaron
jumped over too and joined her, and both sat down
in the middle of the ring and tried to picture the
wonderful scenes that took place there at night.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder where they live by day, and which way
they come here,&#8221; she asked, looking about her eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon they come every way,&#8221; said Aaron.
&#8220;Some live in the flowers and things, and some in
caves and shells, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think the piskies come too, and the
buccas, and all?&#8221;</p>

<p>Aaron shook his head.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>&#8220;I reckon those that have got to work don&#8217;t get
no time for dancing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I like the piskies the best,&#8221; said Loveday
thoughtfully; &#8220;but, of course, I love them all!&#8221;
she added hastily, in a louder voice, for she did not
want to hurt any one&#8217;s feelings, and fairies were very
easily offended, she had heard. &#8220;Of course, I love
them all; but I do love the piskies very much, &#8217;cause
they work and play too; they come and do people&#8217;s
work for them and look after them, and then they
dance, and are such jolly little things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They take care of my daddy,&#8221; said Aaron gravely.
&#8220;Sometimes he&#8217;s got to be out to sea all night, fishing,
and it is dark, and the wind blowing, and the rain
coming down like anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My daddy has got to be out all night too, very
often,&#8221; chimed in Loveday, not to be outdone in
importance by Aaron, &#8220;and he&#8217;s got to drive all
through the thunder and lightning and snow, and
sometimes it is <i>so</i> slippery Betty can&#8217;t hardly walk,
but daddy&#8217;s <i>got</i> to go &#8217;cause somebody is ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he doesn&#8217;t have to go on the sea,&#8221; said Aaron,
&#8220;and p&#8217;r&#8217;aps be drowned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has to drive, and horses tumble down, and
run away, and wheels come off and all sorts of things,&#8221;
said Loveday, not to be outdone.</p>

<p>&#8220;But there are sharks and whales and&mdash;and torpedoes
at sea,&#8221; went on Aaron; but Loveday pretended
not to hear him; and suddenly it occurred to him
that, if he aggravated her too much, she might
begin to call him &#8220;Adolphus&#8221; again; so he hurriedly
changed the conversation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>&#8220;I wish I could see some piskies at work&mdash;don&#8217;t
you?&#8221; said Aaron.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes!&#8221; sighed Loveday. &#8220;Do you think we
could if we stayed up till twelve o&#8217;clock one night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know; I never heard of anybody hereabouts
seeing them. Perhaps they don&#8217;t come to these
parts now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think they do, or they would tidy Mr.
Winter&#8217;s garden for him and weed his path. It is
<i>very</i> untidy, isn&#8217;t it? It looks just like a place no one
lives in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aaron nodded; he had never seen it in any other
condition, so was not so much impressed as was Loveday.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could make it nice for him. I&#8217;d like
to make it look so nice&mdash;all in one night&mdash;that when
he came out he&#8217;d be&mdash;oh! ever so s&#8217;prised, and he&#8217;d
wonder and wonder who had done it, and he&#8217;d say:
&#8216;Why, a fairy must have been here at work.&#8217; That&#8217;s
what father and mother say sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aaron looked at her with interest. He liked to
hear her stories of her home, and what she did there.
Some of them were very wonderful. But Loveday
had no stories to tell that afternoon; she was very
thoughtful and quiet, and sat for quite a long time
without speaking. Aaron began at last to grow tired of
staying still, and was just about to get up, when she
suddenly turned to him, all excitement:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking, and I&#8217;ve thought of&mdash;oh, <i>ever</i>
such a nice plan. Let&#8217;s play that we are piskies, and
come up in the night and tidy Mr. Winter&#8217;s garden for
him, and make him think it is a fairy that has done it,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
and&mdash;and then we&#8217;d come again, and he&#8217;d think the
fairies had been again. Shall we, Aaron? Oh, do
say yes; and it will be a secret, and nobody must
ever know, and everybody will wonder&mdash;and oh, it will
be simply, simply splendid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aaron listened eagerly, quite carried away by her
enthusiasm. Loveday, with her ideas, her wild plans,
and strange thoughts, was a constant wonder to him,
and where she led he followed&mdash;if he could.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t all the folks be wondering and talking
when it gets about?&#8221; he cried excitedly, &#8220;and won&#8217;t
it be funny to be listening to them, and we knowing
all the time all &#8217;bout it! Oh, it&#8217;ll be grand!&#8221;</p>

<p>For quite a long while they sat and discussed their
plans delightedly, and of course there were a great
many plans to be made. Aaron it was who first saw
difficulties in the way of carrying them out.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how&#8217;re we going to get out in the night?&#8221;
he cried. &#8220;Mother and father would hear us.
&#8217;Twould be dark, too, and if we was to slip and fall
climbing up the cliff, we&#8217;d be killed as dead as&mdash;as
dead as pilchards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pilchards don&#8217;t fall down cliffs,&#8221; said Loveday
scornfully.</p>

<p>But she was obliged to admit that there were
difficulties which would not be very easy to get over,
and they walked about with very anxious, serious faces
and dampened spirits&mdash;it did seem bitter to be balked
now.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I know what we can do,&#8221; said Loveday
at last; &#8220;isn&#8217;t it light very early in the morning
now?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s full day by four o&#8217;clock, and earlier,&#8221;
said Aaron.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll get up then, and we can get out of
my window quite easily, and then we can run up the
cliff and be piskies till it&#8217;s time to come home; then
we&#8217;ll run down and jump into bed, and then, when
Bessie calls us, we&#8217;ll be asleep; and we&#8217;ll get up,
and nobody won&#8217;t know anything. We can do that,
can&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Aaron, &#8220;I reckon we might; but
I think we&#8217;d best be going home now&mdash;it feels like
tea-time, and mother will be wondering where we&#8217;ve
got to.&#8221;</p>

<small>LOVEDAY AND AARON PLAY AT BEING
PISKIES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap3">LOVEDAY could scarcely sleep at all that night,
she was so afraid that they would not wake
up early enough to start. In fact, she was
so afraid of oversleeping that after Bessie had
seen her to bed and said &#8220;Good-night,&#8221; she
slipped out again and put on some of her clothes,
partly that she might be so far dressed when morning
came, and partly that the discomfort of them might
prevent her sleeping too soundly.</p>

<p>Her plan answered well. All night she was constantly
turning and waking, and she was glad enough
when daylight came at last. She did not know what
the time was, but she got up, and, tiptoeing out,
called Aaron. It was not very easy to wake him;
he had not troubled to sleep in his clothes, or to do
anything else to make him wake early. Loveday,
afraid to shout at him, or to make any noise at all, took
the water-bottle, thinking that a drop or two of water
on his face might answer better than anything, but
the water, unfortunately, did not drop&mdash;it poured all
down his face and neck in a cold stream, and Aaron
started up with a howl which filled Loveday with
dismay and vexation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>&#8220;Oh, you silly, you!&#8221; she cried crossly; &#8220;do be
quiet, and don&#8217;t be so stupid. Don&#8217;t you remember
what we are going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Aaron, cross enough himself now,
&#8220;but I want to go to sleep.&#8221; He did not feel at all
in the mood for playing at being a pisky. Loveday,
though, was determined, and after a moment the
sleepiness and crossness passed, and he began to feel
the excitement of their plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make haste and dress,&#8221; said Loveday firmly. &#8220;I
shan&#8217;t be long.&#8221;</p>

<p>And in a remarkably short space of time they
had dressed and crept out of her window, and were
scrambling hurriedly up the steep cliff-path.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how lovely!&#8221;</p>

<p>Young as she was, Loveday had to keep on stopping
to admire the beauty of the scene; the sea, and sky,
and land, all radiant in the glorious glow of sunrise,
the sparkling heavy sea, the towering cliffs, and over
all the singing of happy birds. More than once they
had to pause on their way and gaze about them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we could always get up as early as this,&#8221;
sighed Loveday. &#8220;I think I shall, and I&#8217;ll try and
make Priscilla and Geoffrey get up too; the other
parts of the day are never so pretty. I wish Prissy
could see it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen it like this scores of times,&#8221; said Aaron,
in a tone that implied: &#8220;This is nothing to me; I
am used to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet you wanted to stay on in bed and sleep,&#8221;
flashed Loveday scornfully.</p>

<p>But with so much before them to be done, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
could not linger long to gaze, and presently making
up their minds not to stop again, they hurried on as
fast as they could, and by the time they reached
Mr. Winter&#8217;s gate they were too full of their own
daring to have any thoughts to spare for anything else.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t think why people have such horrid noisy
stuff put on their paths,&#8221; said Loveday, after they
had made several vain attempts to creep over the loose
pebbles without making a sound. She was glancing
up at the windows all the time, for it really seemed
to her that their attempts must have roused every one
in the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do first?&#8221; she whispered to Aaron.
&#8220;I think the flower-beds look the worst of all, but if
they never draw up the blinds they won&#8217;t see how
nice we&#8217;ve made them.&#8221;</p>

<p>And if this was not quite the real reason, and if
Loveday&#8217;s courage did fail at the thought of setting
things right there, who could wonder when one looked
at the state of the place? It was a task which would
have taken two or three men many days of hard work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we begin by weeding the steps and the
path before the door?&#8221; she suggested, and, Aaron
agreeing, they fell to work busily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does Mr. Winter ever come out of this door
and walk here?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>She was very full of curiosity as to Mr. Winter
and his doings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Aaron; &#8220;he comes out this way to
go to that garden over there, where they grow fruit
and vegetables. He takes a brave bit of interest in
that garden.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>Loveday sat back on her heels, and looked in the
direction Aaron was pointing.</p>

<p>&#8220;He built a high wall all round it, so&#8217;s he
shouldn&#8217;t see the sea and nobody shouldn&#8217;t see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;ve done enough here for one day,
don&#8217;t you?&#8221; sighed Loveday, who detested weeding.</p>

<p>&#8220;That I do,&#8221; declared Aaron emphatically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we do something in that garden now, where
Mr. Winter would see it, and be glad, and wonder who
did it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Aaron nodded, and rose stiffly to his feet. &#8220;I wish
&#8217;twas breakfast-time,&#8221; he sighed.</p>

<p>Loveday thought the kitchen-garden by far the
nicest bit that she had seen yet of Mr. Winter&#8217;s
grounds. She felt safer there, too, for she could not be
seen from the house, nor heard, and the place itself
did not seem so hopeless of improvement. There was
plenty to be done, or so they thought, but what they
did, did make some show.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we will tidy away all that straw first of all,&#8221;
she said; &#8220;it makes that bed look so untidy, and I
expect all the slugs and snails go to sleep in it. We can&#8217;t
burn it to-day, so we&#8217;ll put it in a heap here for the
time, and perhaps to-morrow we&#8217;ll bring some matches.
If we&#8217;re very early nobody will see the smoke.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Aaron was doubtful of that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Porthcallis folks gets up early,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
father might see it as he brought the boat in. The
smoke would show for miles round.&#8221;</p>

<p>They found a supply of tools in a shed in the garden,
but they were rather big and heavy, so they gathered
up the straw in their arms, and carried it away, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
caused a good deal of running over the bed, and left
many footprints.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we ought to rake it over before we go,&#8221;
said Loveday, looking at it rather anxiously; &#8220;nobody
would think piskies&#8217; feet had left marks like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aaron agreed, and between them they used the
long rake, until the bed looked really quite nice and
tidy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear,&#8221; sighed Loveday, as they put away the
tools at last, &#8220;I think piskies must get very tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And hungry, too!&#8221; sighed Aaron, who felt
famished.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am starving,&#8221; said Loveday, &#8220;but I think it
must be nearly breakfast-time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t five yet, I believe,&#8221; said Aaron dolefully;
&#8220;and breakfast won&#8217;t be ready till past seven.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More than two hours to wait!&#8221; gasped Loveday;
&#8220;I can&#8217;t, I simply can&#8217;t. Don&#8217;t you think we&#8217;ve done
enough for one day?&#8221; she asked, after a moment&#8217;s
pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t I!&#8221; said Aaron, in a tone which said
plainly that on this matter he had no doubt.</p>

<p>Very, very carefully the pair crept out of the
kitchen-garden, past the house, and over the pebbled
path.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we had made that part look a little nicer,&#8221;
said Loveday, glancing with tired, wistful eyes over
the desolate bit of ground around the house, &#8220;but I
s&#8217;pose even piskies couldn&#8217;t do it all at once, could
they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not unless there are hundreds of &#8217;em,&#8221; said
Aaron, &#8220;and we&#8217;m only two.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>The glorious hues were fading fast from the sky
now, and the sun shone with the pale clear light of
early morning. The sea still sparkled, and the birds
sang, but the children paid little heed to either; they
were too hungry and tired. The walk home was rather
a silent one, and they got into the house so easily
that there was no excitement there to arouse them.
With scarcely a word they quietly separated, slipped
off their things and crept into their beds again, and,
fortunately for them, soon fell asleep and forgot their
hunger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I never! What a sleepy-head!&#8221; cried
Bessie some time later. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with
you both, I wonder? I had to strip the bed-clothes
off Aaron and pull away his pillows before I could
rouse him, and here are you, Miss Loveday, pretty
nearly as bad. Come along, jump up! Here&#8217;s your
bath, and breakfast will be ready in half-an-hour.
You won&#8217;t go to sleep again, will you, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No-o,&#8221; said Loveday, in a very, very drowsy
voice, &#8220;but I&mdash;I think you&#8217;d better lift me out, Bessie,
or&mdash;p&#8217;r&#8217;aps&mdash;I may&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>And Bessie took her at her word, and lifted her
right out of her snug little bed and stood her on the
floor.</p>

<p>But more than once that day Bessie looked at them
both with a puzzled face. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know when I&#8217;ve
seen them look so tired,&#8221; she said to herself. &#8220;I
s&#8217;pose it&#8217;s the weather.&#8221; And later in the day, when
she went to call them in to tea, and found Loveday
curled up on the sand, sound asleep, her spade and
bucket lying beside her&mdash;and Aaron fast asleep too,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
his book fallen out of his hand&mdash;she looked puzzled
again, and rather troubled. &#8220;It can&#8217;t be anything
but the weather, I should think,&#8221; she murmured; &#8220;I
don&#8217;t think they can be sickening for anything, they
ain&#8217;t a bit feverish, and their appetites are good.&#8221;
And after their nap and their tea they were so bright
and lively again, that Bessie&#8217;s fears all vanished, and
the weather was, as usual, blamed unjustly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; Loveday whispered many times
during the day&mdash;&#8220;I wonder what Mr. Winter thought
when he saw what we&#8217;d done? I wonder if he saw
it, and if he was very, very glad? Do you think he
would think about piskies, and guess that they did it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno,&#8221; said Aaron stolidly. &#8220;I reckon he
don&#8217;t put down nothing for fairies and such-like; but
there isn&#8217;t nobody else that could do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night they took care to hide some of their
supper in their pockets for the morning. Aaron was
not quite so excited about the pisky plan as he had
been, but Loveday was full of it; the thought of
what they had done and of Mr. Winter&#8217;s pleasure gave
her fresh zeal and energy. She longed for the next
morning to come, that she might look again on what
they had done, and work more wonders. This time
she determined that they really would try to make the
garden near the house look neater; they would not shirk
it a second time, but would really begin to work at it at
once, and give all their time and attention to it. Again
she slept in her clothes, and again she called Aaron very
early. This morning, though, there was no glorious
sunrise to cheer or delay them; the dawn was grey
and chilly; a wet sea-fog hung over everything, making<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
it damp and dull. No birds sang to-day. As the
children mounted the cliff, the world below seemed
cut off from them, and they themselves might have
been in cloudland.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now it really does seem as though we had
walked into the sky,&#8221; said Loveday. &#8220;I am glad
Priscilla isn&#8217;t here; she would be frightened, I expect,
but of course I know all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though they had no sunshine or beauty to gaze
at, they had bread to eat, and that helped to keep up
their spirits and their energies.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if real piskies come out in weather like
this,&#8221; said Loveday, laughing at the white fringe of
mist which outlined Aaron&#8217;s stubby head and blue
cap, and her own curls and scarlet <i>b&eacute;ret</i>. &#8220;We look
like Father Christmas.&#8221;</p>

<p>The damp made the pebbles on the garden path
less noisy to walk over, so that they got up to the
house more easily, but before they began their attack
on the most neglected part, they decided that they
must have one peep at their work of yesterday; so
they crept into the kitchen-garden and down to the
cleared bed. But, to their amazement and disgust,
there was no cleared bed! They looked and looked,
and stared at each other and back again, but there
was no mistake. Some one or something had spread
straw all over it again, and it was just as untidy as ever!</p>

<p>&#8220;That <i>must</i> be the wicked fairies!&#8221; cried Loveday
indignantly. &#8220;The nasty, naughty, wicked things!
They got here first, and this is what they have done,
just to annoy us and Mr. Winter! It is <i>too</i> bad. I
only hope he saw it yesterday as we left it for him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
I think it&#8217;s dreadful of them to annoy a poor man like
that, when he&#8217;s so sad. I don&#8217;t know how they can
behave so!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, it&#8217;s just like &#8217;em,&#8221; said Aaron gravely.
&#8220;They don&#8217;t care, they&#8217;m that bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was looking very solemn and rather nervous;
he really did not like having to do with any place
or thing that the wicked fairies had been near; for
if they were vexed they did not care, as he said, what
they did to the person who vexed them. He was
for hurrying away to another part of the garden, and
was actually starting, when, to his horror, he saw
Loveday collecting the straw from the bed again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t; you&#8217;d better not touch it!&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;If the bad ones put it there, they&#8217;ll pay you out
fine for meddling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; said Loveday. &#8220;It&#8217;s poor Mr. Winter
I&#8217;m thinking about, and I don&#8217;t care what they do. I
am going to make his garden nice for him, poor man!&#8221;</p>

<p>And she went to work again in a way that showed
that she meant it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along, Aaron,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t
leave me to do it all. Do help.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aaron was divided. He did not much like the
idea of working by himself in another part of the
garden, and he did not relish the task before him, but
in the end he stood by Loveday very pluckily, and
soon they had once more collected all the straw and
raked up the bed as before.</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>wish</i> I had brought a box of matches,&#8221; said
Loveday hotly; &#8220;then I&#8217;d burn the straw, and they
wouldn&#8217;t be able to play such a trick again.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t burn it,&#8221; said Aaron; &#8220;we&#8217;ll carry
it away and heave it to cliff. If they gets it and brings
it back from there&mdash;well, they&#8217;m welcome to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveday agreed with delight, and both of them
chuckled many times over their cleverness in out-witting
the &#8220;little people&#8221; as they struggled to
pack the straw into two bundles bound round by
Loveday&#8217;s over-all and Aaron&#8217;s tunic. It was not a
very easy task, and the garden and the path over which
they dragged their loads were not quite as neat and
speckless as fairy fingers would have left them. But
the pair did not see that; all their thoughts were bent
on &#8220;heaving&#8221; the straw over the cliff into the sea.
And perhaps it was well for their parents and those
who loved them, that they did not see those two as
they leaned over the edge of the steep cliff-top and
shook out their pinafores over the dizzy heights, then
watched the straw as it whirled down and down to
those awful depths below, where the sea dashed and
foamed like a caldron, lashed to anger by the sharp
rocks on which it flung itself. An inch or so farther,
the least slip, the merest over-balancing as they shook
out their loads, and they too would have gone whirling
down through the mist, to the jagged rocks, and the
hungry waves all those feet below, and no earthly
power could have saved them from a fearful death.</p>

<small>THE PISKIES CAUGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">BOTH Aaron and Loveday were very tired when,
for the third time, they rose at dawn, crept
out of the house, and up the cliff; and if
it had not been for the excitement of seeing
what their enemies had done to the vegetable
bed during the night, they would probably have
left their pisky work, for one morning at least. But
Loveday was very anxious to see if the bad piskies had
done anything further when they found all the straw
had been taken away from them. Aaron was excited,
too, but he was more sleepy, and they were both just
the least bit cross as they clambered up the slippery
path.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m jolly glad I am not a real pisky,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;to have to do this every night. I reckon folks would
have to do their work theirselves if &#8217;twas left to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveday did not answer. She felt very much the
same, but she was not going to say so.</p>

<p>They did not sit down this time to enjoy the view,
but munched their crusts as they walked. There was
neither a lovely sunrise, nor a dense sea-fog&mdash;it was
just an ordinary dull, grey morning; and Loveday no
longer felt that for the future she should always rise
with the sun, and try to make every one else do the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
same. Every now and then her thoughts <i>would</i> turn
to her snug, comfortable little bed, though she tried
hard to fix them on something else, for she felt that
if she thought of it too much she should turn and run
back to it, and creep in and lay her weary body out
at full length between the cosy blankets, and her
sleepy head on the pillow, and sleep, and sleep, and
sleep&mdash;all the day through, if she could.</p>

<p>Everything was quiet as usual when they reached
the gate. By this time they had found out how to
walk over the pebbled path without making much
noise.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will try to make that place look very nice
to-day,&#8221; said Loveday; &#8220;I&#8217;ve brought a knife and a
pair of scissors with me, and we&#8217;ll cut off all the great
big straggly things, and the dead things, and &#8216;heave
&#8217;em to cliff&#8217; as we did the straw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one of mother&#8217;s best knives,&#8221; said Aaron
anxiously; &#8220;you&#8217;d best not use that. You should
have brought the &#8217;taty knife, the little dumpy one
she uses for peeling &#8217;taties.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t go back now to change it,&#8221; said
Loveday decidedly. &#8220;I <i>must</i> use this one. One knife
isn&#8217;t very much, and they are meant to cut things
with; we shan&#8217;t hurt it&mdash;besides, Bessie has got more
like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, do as you please,&#8221; said Aaron crossly;
&#8220;only there&#8217;ll be a fine row if it&#8217;s spoilt. Knives&#8221;&mdash;with
that superior, knowing air of his which always
nettled Loveday&mdash;&#8220;costs a brave bit of money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I know that,&#8221; she snapped irritably.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think they grew. Well, I&#8217;ll use the scissors,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
and you can use your hands; unless you brought
something yourself to cut with.&#8221;</p>

<p>But by this time they had reached the walled-in
garden, and in their excitement to see if anything had
happened they forgot their crossness. Along the path
they ran till they reached the bed, then stood still and
looked at each other with wide eyes. The bed was
covered again with straw&mdash;fresh, new straw&mdash;and over
it and across it in all directions was fine cord, stretched
to pegs which had been stuck firmly in the ground.</p>

<p>The two felt quite frightened! Whoever had done
it had spared no trouble in making all secure this
time, but had carried out their work deliberately and
beautifully. The children felt perfectly helpless.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is just to <i>spite</i> us,&#8221; whispered Loveday
furiously.</p>

<p>But Aaron did not speak; he was really puzzled
and alarmed. Thoughts were working so fast in his
brain, too, that he could not catch one and put it into
words. Loveday grew annoyed and half frightened
by his silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think it is? Who do you think
did it? Aaron, speak! Are you frightened? Do
you think it is something that will hurt us?&#8221;</p>

<p>But in answer to all her eager questions, Aaron
only said at last:</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno; I don&#8217;t like the looks on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveday was really rather alarmed, but to find
Aaron even more so, and without a word to encourage
her, made her very cross again.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> don&#8217;t like the looks of all that cord,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and I&#8217;m going to cut it all, just to let them see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
that <i>I</i> am not afraid of them. <i>I</i> am not a
coward.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Aaron! It was a little hard on him, for
he really had begun to feel a horrible dread that it
might not, after all, have been piskies&#8217; mischief that
they were undoing, but some real person&#8217;s careful
work, and he was just beginning to say so when they
heard quick footsteps coming along the path towards
them, and, looking up, saw an elderly, grey-haired man
with a very white and angry face and a pair of eyes
with a look in them which filled Loveday&#8217;s little heart
with alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Mr. Winter!&#8221; gasped Aaron.</p>

<p>That news did not increase Loveday&#8217;s alarm; it
rather lessened it, in fact, for, in the first place, she
wanted very much to see this mysterious person, and,
in the second place, she had always a feeling that sad
people were never <i>very</i> angry about anything: they
were too gentle, and had so much else to think about.
But Mr. Winter soon undeceived her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; he cried hotly, &#8220;and what are
you doing in my garden, you young ragamuffins?
What are you doing, I say? Is it you who have been
tampering with my beds day after day, and ruining
all my seeds?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir,&#8221; began Aaron, stammering and stuttering,
and frightened nearly out of his wits&mdash;&#8220;please, sir,
we didn&#8217;t mean no &#8217;arm; we didn&#8217;t know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What didn&#8217;t you know? You knew you had
no right in here. You will know it now, at any rate,
for you will just wait here until I get a policeman;
then perhaps you will remember another time.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>&#8220;A policeman!&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveday was filled with horror, and could scarcely
believe her ears. A policeman to be sent for, for her,
Miss Loveday Carlyon! Oh, it couldn&#8217;t be true!
He couldn&#8217;t mean it! It was a mistake. But oh, if
only father were here, or mother, to explain!</p>

<p>They were far away, though, and Mr. Winter was
here, talking more and more angrily, and saying,
&#8220;Come with me, come with me, and I&#8217;ll see that you
are safe till the police come!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must explain to him myself,&#8221; thought Loveday.
&#8220;Aaron isn&#8217;t any good&#8221;&mdash;which was quite true,
for all Aaron&#8217;s thoughts were taken up in trying not
to cry. He was much too scared to speak. Loveday
went a little nearer the angry old man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, Mr. Winter,&#8221; she said, but very tremblingly,
&#8220;we only wanted to do something kind for
you. We weren&#8217;t stealing, or doing any harm. We
never touched a flower&mdash;we didn&#8217;t see one to touch,
but we wouldn&#8217;t have if we had.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Winter stopped in his angry words as soon
as she began to speak. Expecting, as he had, to hear
the speech of one of the village children, Loveday&#8217;s
pretty, refined voice gave him a shock of surprise. He
looked at her more keenly, and with some curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kind!&#8221; he cried; &#8220;what do you mean? You
wanted to be kind? Why should you? And why
should you come into my garden to play pranks, and
then call them kindnesses? Why are you up and out
wandering about the country at this hour of the
morning? Whose children are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Aaron Lobb; his father and mother live<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
in your cottage under the cliff; and I am Loveday
Carlyon, Dr. Carlyon&#8217;s daughter. I&#8217;ve come from
Trelint to stay with Bessie for&mdash;for my health, and
one day Aaron and I came up here with a message,
and your garden looked <i>so</i> untidy, I wished the piskies
would come and make it nice for you. And then we
thought we would pretend to be piskies and get up
very, very early, and make it all nice and tidy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; snapped the old gentleman, &#8220;my
garden was not untidy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but please it was, dreadfully&mdash;I mean it
looked so to me,&#8221; urged Loveday, struggling with her
sense of truth and her desire to be polite. &#8220;I mean
that outside part in front of the windows where
the blinds are all drawn down. That was what we
meant to tidy. I thought if you saw it looking tidy,
and flowers growing, you wouldn&#8217;t feel so sad. It was
that untidy part that made us think of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; chimed in Aaron nervously; &#8220;please,
sir, we didn&#8217;t never mean to come in here, but&mdash;but
the other was so hard, and then we looked in here,
and saw all the straw littered about&mdash;it reg&#8217;lar&#8217;y
covered that bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it did,&#8221; said Mr. Winter. &#8220;I had had
that bed sown with seeds of a rare and delicate kind,
and covered them most carefully with straw to protect
them, and&mdash;and you have destroyed them all by uncovering
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I <i>am</i> sorry!&#8221; cried Loveday, drawing nearer
to him. &#8220;But why didn&#8217;t you put something there
to say so? If we had only known, we would have
put on more stuff to keep them warm.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>&#8220;But when you invaded my garden the second
time, and saw that the bed had been covered again
with straw, couldn&#8217;t you understand that it was done
for a purpose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We thought the piskies had done it,&#8221; said Loveday,
as though that excused everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;You thought <i>what</i>!&#8221; cried the gentleman.
&#8220;You thought the piskies&mdash;! Oh dear, dear! To
think that such ignorance should exist in this twentieth
century! It is disgraceful!&#8221; Then, turning
to the children: &#8220;Come with me while I decide
what can be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loveday followed with less fear than she would
have felt a few moments earlier. For one reason, Mr.
Winter did not seem quite so angry as he had at first;
for another, he had not spoken again of policemen;
and, for a third reason, she was rather anxious to see
what the house looked like inside.</p>

<p>But here she was disappointed, for Mr. Winter
led them so quickly through the bare stone hall that
they saw very little of the house, and then he showed
them into a small, bare room, with a window high up
out of their reach, and there left them. And as he
went they heard him turn the key on them, at which
they looked at each other in horror, while he walked
slowly away to his own sitting-room to think; for
what to do with the pair now he had them was more
than he could tell. He wanted to frighten them, yet
he had no thought now of sending for a policeman.
In fact, he would have liked to have sent them both
away with a warning, only he thought it was better
that they should be kept a little longer as a punishment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>Meanwhile, Bessie, having got up very early to be
ready for her husband on his return from his fishing,
went to call Aaron rather earlier than usual, and was
shocked to find his bed empty and himself flown.
Astonished and troubled, she went to Loveday&#8217;s room,
and, opening the door gently, peeped in. When she
found Loveday&#8217;s room empty too, and the windows
wide open, she grew really alarmed. She listened,
but there was no sound but the voice of the sea and
the gulls. The silence frightened her. Where could
they be? She ran to the front door, and looked out
over the sands. No; no sign of them there. She
searched the house and called and called, but no
answer came. What could she do next? Find them
she must, but where? Her eye fell on the sparkling
sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, not out there!&#8221; she cried, turning sick with
fear.</p>

<p>Far out she saw the boats coming in, but they
could not help her or tell her anything. She turned
away, unable to bear the sight; and as she did so her
eye fell on the path up the cliff. A ray of comfort
crept into her heart. Something seemed to tell her
that that path would lead her to them. Of course,
there was risk there, too, but not such risk.</p>

<p>Without waiting to put on hat or shawl, poor
Bessie hurried up the steep path. She forced herself
to look over the rugged sides every now and then,
though it made her feel ill to do so, until she came
at last to that spot where the children had thrown
the straw over the day before. But when she came
to that she turned away, faint and full of horror.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>&#8220;I can&#8217;t look,&#8221; she groaned. &#8220;I can&#8217;t! I can&#8217;t!
I&#8217;ll get a fence put round there if I have to do it
myself. The least little slip, and nothing could save
one, whether man, woman, child, or poor dumb
animal.&#8221;</p>

<p>When she reached the top of the hill she met a new
perplexity. Where could she look now? Which way
could she go?&mdash;to Mr. Winter&#8217;s, or right on over the
downs which stretched away to the very edge of the
cliff?</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;they wouldn&#8217;t go to Mr.
Winter&#8217;s if they could help it;&#8221; and she turned and
walked in the other direction, on and on, past the
Fairy Ring, and all the time she gazed about her, but
never a speck of anything living or moving could she
see, and she turned away in despair. Coming slowly
back, she once more reached Mr. Winter&#8217;s gate.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a good mind to go in and ask Mrs. Tucker
if she has caught sight or sound of them,&#8221; she sighed.
&#8220;It isn&#8217;t likely, but when one&#8217;s in despair&mdash; Oh, my
Aaron! my Aaron and Miss Loveday! What will the
master and missus say?&#8221;</p>

<p>And poor Bessie had begun to cry with fright and
misery, when, just as she had turned in at Mr. Winter&#8217;s
gate, who should she see coming down the pebbly
path towards her but two dejected little figures,
walking hand in hand.</p>

<p>At the first sight of her they paused, hardly
recognising her, and half afraid&mdash;then, with a cry,
they rushed into her arms, and for a few minutes
all three wept together.</p>

<p>&#8220;What &#8217;ave &#8217;ee been doing&mdash;where &#8217;ave &#8217;ee been?&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
cried Bessie, the first to check her tears. &#8220;Oh, my
dear life, the fright you&#8217;ve gived me, Aaron! I ought
to lace your jacket for you; it&#8217;s what you deserves.
But I haven&#8217;t the heart to. Oh, my dear life! the
fright I&#8217;ve had, and how glad I am to see &#8217;ee both.
I don&#8217;t know what I haven&#8217;t thought might have
happened to &#8217;ee. But what have you been doing, you
naughty, naughty children, to leave your beds and
get out of window like that? I&#8217;ll never be able to
trust &#8217;ee any more, and I&#8217;ll have bars put to them
windows before I sleep to-night!&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time some of their alarm had passed off,
but the children sobbed on, partly from hunger, partly
from weariness and shock, but a great deal from the
sense of their naughtiness to poor Bessie, who had
been so good and kind to them; and it was not until
they had sobbed out all their story that they could
control themselves and feel at all comforted.</p>

<p>Bessie did not scold them any more, but she looked
very grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;there is no knowing what Mr.
Winter will do, for he is a funny kind of gentleman,
and you were very naughty children; and what you
have to do now is to make up your minds to bear
what he does do. A pretty fine tale I&#8217;ve got to write
to your ma and pa, Miss Loveday,&#8221; she added, &#8220;and
a nice bit of news you&#8217;ve got for father when he comes
home&#8221;&mdash;turning to Aaron&mdash;&#8220;and he been out all
night too, working hard to get you food and clothes!&#8221;</p>

<p>Aaron began to weep again, touched to the heart
by remorse.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll write to daddy myself and tell him,&#8221; sighed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
Loveday penitently. &#8220;Perhaps it won&#8217;t frighten him
so much if he hears it from me first. I&#8217;ll write directly
after breakfast, and then I&#8217;ll go and post it. May I,
Bessie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, miss, if you&#8217;ll promise not to run away
again,&#8221; said Bessie severely. &#8220;You see, I don&#8217;t feel
sure now about trusting either of you. I think I shall
have to hobble you both, like they do the goats, or
tether you.&#8221;</p>

<p>At which Loveday felt more humbled than ever
she had in her life before.</p>

<small>PRISCILLA PAYS A CALL AND TAKES A
JOURNEY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">BY this time Priscilla was so much better she
was able to go for short walks and, best of all,
for drives with her father. She loved these
better than anything, for she had her father
all to herself, and it was delightful to sit
propped up with cushions, and with no strap around
her to keep her from falling out, and so to drive Betsy
up the hills, for she could manage that with her one
hand, while her father read to her.</p>

<p>One day they drove to Lady Carey&#8217;s house. Priscilla
did not like that very well, for she had not seen
Lady Carey since that dreadful day when she had
caught her sweeping the drawing-room. But Lady
Carey was not very well, and Dr. Carlyon had been
sent for, and as she had been very kind to Geoffrey
and Priscilla while they were ill, and had sent them
fruit and flowers and picture-papers, he thought
Priscilla should go herself and thank her for her
kindness, if Lady Carey was well enough to see her.</p>

<p>Lady Carey was well enough, and after the doctor
had paid his visit, he came out to the carriage for
Priscilla, who had been sitting there feeling very
nervous all the time, and half hoping, though she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
would not have liked any one to know it, that Lady
Carey would decide that she felt too unwell and too
tired to see visitors.</p>

<p>She looked as grave and nervous as she felt when
her father lifted her down from the dog-cart, and
straightened her hat and her frock, and led her through
the big, cool, flower-scented hall to the pretty, shady
room where Lady Carey sat in her big chair by the
open window looking out on the flower-garden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Priscilla has come to thank you for all your
kindness to her, and to say good-bye before going to
Porthcallis,&#8221; said the doctor; and Priscilla walked
sedately up to the pretty invalid, shook hands, and,
after only a second&#8217;s nervous hesitation, put up her
face to kiss her.</p>

<p>Lady Carey returned the kiss very heartily, and
pulling a little low chair close to her, told Priscilla to
sit on it.</p>

<p>Priscilla did so gladly; it was such a charming
little chair, with gilt legs and back and a cushioned
seat of a delicate grey silk with roses worked all over it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how pretty&mdash;&#8221; she began, then stopped
abruptly as she remembered Nurse&#8217;s directions that it
is not polite to remark on what one sees, and at the same
moment she noticed that her father had gone away
and left her alone with her hostess.</p>

<p>But before she could feel alarmed by this, Lady
Carey had begun to talk to her, and to ask her questions
about her arm, and her illness, and her coming visit
to the seaside, and then about Loveday; and very
soon Priscilla was telling her all about Loveday and
her bucket, and Aaron, and Miss Potts, and all sorts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
of things; and Lady Carey told Priscilla of how she
used to stay by the sea when she was a little girl, and
all kinds of other interesting tales; and Priscilla felt
that she could stay there and listen to her and talk to
her for ever so long. But presently Dr. Carlyon put
his head in again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Carey, I think your visitor has stayed long
enough for one day. Will you tell her to go, please?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Carey laughed. &#8220;I shall tell you to go for
just five minutes longer,&#8221; she said brightly. &#8220;I have
something I especially want to say to Priscilla before
we part.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I must, then,&#8221; said the doctor, laughing,
as he turned away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you ring that bell for me, Priscilla, please?&#8221;
said Lady Carey, as soon as he had gone.</p>

<p>Priscilla went over and pulled very, very carefully
at a pretty silk bell-pull which hung beside the fireplace.
It was a very gentle pull, but it answered all
right, for in a moment a very neat and smiling maid
appeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sanders, will you go to my room and bring me
down that parcel you placed on the table at the foot
of my bed this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, &#8217;m,&#8221; said Sanders; and away she went, and
in a moment or so was back again with a big paper
parcel in her hand, which she handed to Lady Carey.</p>

<p>Priscilla looked on with interest, wondering what
it all meant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have something here,&#8221; said Lady Carey, untying
the string, &#8220;that I have been making for you and your
little sister; and I want to give you yours now, and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
will ask you to take Loveday&#8217;s to her, for I think you
may both find them useful by the sea;&#8221; and, unwrapping
the paper, Lady Carey took out and shook
out a pretty warm cloak, big enough to cover Priscilla
to the hem of her skirts. It was made of a soft blue
cloth, bound with ribbon, and it had a hood lined
with silk of the same shade.</p>

<p>Priscilla was so delighted and surprised when she
saw it, and heard that it was for her, that she could
hardly speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now try it on,&#8221; said Lady Carey; and Priscilla
was soon enveloped in the cloak, with the hood drawn
over her curls, and her grey eyes and pretty pale face
looked up at her kind friend so gratefully that Lady
Carey drew her to her, and held her very close as she
kissed her affectionately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!&#8221; cried
Priscilla, finding her voice at last. &#8220;I love my cloak;
I think it is perfectly beautiful!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Lady Carey undid the other parcel, and took
out a red one made in the same way.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is for Loveday. Do you think she will
like it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla was again almost speechless with delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;She will <i>love</i> hers too,&#8221; she cried at last rapturously.
&#8220;And she looks so pretty in red. Thank you,
Lady Carey, very much indeed. Oh, I want Loveday
to see them both, now, at once, and I want mother to
see, and father. O father,&#8221; she cried, running to him
as he came into the room again, &#8220;<i>do</i> look at what
Lady Carey has made for Loveday and me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Of how she got out of the house, of her good-byes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
and her drive home Priscilla remembered nothing. Of
course, she wore her blue cloak&mdash;it would have been
too much to expect her not to&mdash;and when she got
home she flew into the house to tell her mother her
news. But the next thing that clearly stood out in
Priscilla&#8217;s mind when she thought it all over afterwards
was her father&#8217;s coming into the room with a letter in
his hand. Mrs. Carlyon was sitting with Loveday&#8217;s
red cloak in her hands (Priscilla always remembered
that); her own she was still wearing, and was feeling
it rather warm, when her father drove all other
thoughts out of her head by saying: &#8220;Just listen,
dear, to this extraordinary letter that I have had from
Loveday,&#8221; and he read it aloud.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My dear Daddy</span>,&mdash;Plese will you come at once,
I am in great truble I wassent nawty reely but mr.
winter sais we are and he was going to get a polisman,
but he diden, he let us go home whil he thot what he
shud do to punnish us I hop he won&#8217;t send us to
prissen, Bessie lost us and cride and took us home.
Do come quik, I am very sory, we were piskies. How
is prissy.&mdash;Your loving</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Loveday.</span> Do come quik.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>As she listened to this letter Priscilla thought she
should have fainted with fright. Policemen! and
prison! and Loveday perhaps with handcuffs on, and
oh, so frightened! She looked with a white face and
terrified eyes at her mother, who was still holding the
red cloak, and, somehow, the sight of that made it all
seem more dreadful.</p>

<p>&#8220;O father, what can we do?&#8221; she cried piteously.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
&#8220;Loveday shan&#8217;t go to prison; she mustn&#8217;t! She
can&#8217;t have been naughty enough for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>But to her surprise her father, instead of being
frightened and angry, looked almost as though he were
amused about something&mdash;at least, until he glanced
at Priscilla; but when he saw her white face, he grew
grave at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be foolish, darling,&#8221; he said, drawing her
to him. &#8220;You surely aren&#8217;t really frightened. It
cannot be anything very serious, or Bessie would have
written too, or telegraphed; she wouldn&#8217;t have left
it to Loveday to have told us all about a serious matter.
I expect the truth of it is that Miss Loveday and
Master Aaron have been up to some mischief, and
some one&mdash;a Mr. Winter I think she calls him&mdash;has
frightened them, or tried to, by talking about prison
and police.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Carlyon, who had been lost in thought for
some minutes, suddenly looked up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Winter!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Why, that is
the name of that poor gentleman whose only son was
drowned there, before his father&#8217;s eyes, some few years
ago. He has shut himself up there ever since. Don&#8217;t
you remember, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course; yes, I remember now,&#8221; said the
doctor, nodding his head thoughtfully. &#8220;A curious,
morose old man. I met him once. I think it is his
cottage that the Lobbs live in.&#8221;</p>

<p>All this time he was sitting with one arm round
Priscilla, who stood very silent, with her head laid
against her father&#8217;s shoulder, her face very white and
troubled still. &#8220;It is all right, dear, I am sure,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
said, suddenly noticing how ill she looked; &#8220;don&#8217;t you
worry about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, father, do you think it is all right?&#8221; asked
Priscilla, in a trembling voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; said Dr. Carlyon cheerfully. &#8220;I
haven&#8217;t a doubt. I think I will go and send a telegram
to Bessie to say I will just run down to-morrow for
the day,&#8221; he added; &#8220;then I shall know for certain
what is amiss. And, what do you say? Shall I take
Prissy with me, instead of waiting till next week?
The change will be good for her, I think, and, at any
rate, she will have Loveday under her eye, and know
that the policeman has not got her locked up in a cell.
While I am there I can look about for rooms, too, for
the rest of us. Don&#8217;t you think those are very nice
plans, little woman?&#8221;&mdash;turning to Priscilla. &#8220;You
would like to go down with me to-morrow, wouldn&#8217;t
you, and help look for rooms for mother and
Geoffrey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; cried Priscilla, throwing one arm about
her father&#8217;s neck and kissing him, &#8220;please, father;&#8221;
and her face, though still very pale, grew brighter and
less alarmed-looking.</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;do you think it will be all right to wait till
then? They won&#8217;t take away Loveday, or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, they couldn&#8217;t, and wouldn&#8217;t. Of
course not; I expect we shall have a letter by the next
post from Bessie. Now I will go to the office and send
this telegram, and tell Bessie to be sure and let me
know if I must come before to-morrow.&#8221; And away
he went.</p>

<p>After all this Priscilla felt too tired and languid to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
do anything, even to sort out the toys she wanted to
take with her, but when presently a telegram came
back from Bessie to say, &#8220;All well, nothing serious,&#8221;
she felt very much happier, and grew quite excited at
the thought that she was going to see Loveday to-morrow,
and to take her her red cloak, and she lay
back very contentedly in her chair and watched her
mother and Nurse looking over her clothes to see
what they should pack, and then arranging them in
her box.</p>

<p>By the post next morning came Bessie&#8217;s letter
telling them all about Loveday&#8217;s and Aaron&#8217;s escapade.
When Priscilla heard it she felt very frightened again,
for it seemed such a dreadful thing that they had done.
But still her father did not seem very much concerned,
and, seeing him so cheerful, Priscilla tried to be so
too, though in her secret heart she had a great dread
of the morose, mysterious Mr. Winter, and did not
feel at all sure that, after all, he would not fulfil his
threat, and send for a policeman.</p>

<p>However, on a bright sunny morning, with a lot
to do, with farewell visits to pay to Miss Potts, Mrs.
Tickell, and many others, a journey to the sea before
one, two new cloaks, hidden away where they could
easily be got at, a little sister, and the sea, and a holiday
at the end of the journey, no one could feel quite,
quite miserable. And with the sun shining and the
breeze blowing, and Betsy trotting quickly along
between the flower-decked hedges, and Geoffrey
beside one making fun, it did not seem possible
that anything very, very dreadful <i>could</i> happen, and
Priscilla&#8217;s spirits rose enormously.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>She felt quite sorry for Hocking, who was to be left
behind.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Hocking,&#8221; she sighed, &#8220;don&#8217;t you wish you
were going to the seaside too?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Hocking did not seem at all perturbed at
being left behind. &#8220;What&#8217;s the use of wishing,
miss?&#8221; he said slowly; &#8220;if wishes were &#8217;orses beggars
would ride.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla looked at him for a moment, puzzled,
then looked away to try and think out his meaning.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any sense in that,&#8221; she said at last,
having thought the matter over for some time. &#8220;If
they were on horseback they couldn&#8217;t beg, and they
wouldn&#8217;t be beggars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ezzackly, miss,&#8221; said Hocking stolidly, as though
that was what he had been arguing, and did not open
his lips again.</p>

<p>At the station Priscilla kissed Betsy, shook hands
with Hocking, and then went with Geoffrey on to
the platform, while her father took the tickets. She
wished now that Geoffrey was coming too, and she
told him so.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I was,&#8221; said Geoffrey; &#8220;but, you see,
I&#8217;ve got to wait and bring mother and Nurse. If I
hadn&#8217;t, I&#8217;d have gone to old Winter and jolly well
told him what I thought of him for frightening a
child as small as Loveday. I call it cowardly, and&mdash;and
he <i>ought</i> to be told of it too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla gasped at the mere thought of Geoffrey&#8217;s
daring. But after she had said good-bye to him, and
he had driven off homewards with Hocking, and she
and her father had settled down comfortably in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
carriage to themselves, her thoughts flew again to
what he had said about Mr. Winter, and by-and-by a
thought came into her mind, which grew and grew,
until before long it had become a very firm resolution.</p>

<p>If Geoffrey thought it right to go to Mr. Winter
and speak for Loveday, it was right for her to do so.
She could not speak as severely as Geoffrey said he
should, and perhaps it might be better not to; but
she could say something, and she made up her mind
to go on the very first opportunity&mdash;that is, if her
father did not do so&mdash;and ask to see Mr. Winter, and
then apologise for what Loveday had done, and ask
him to forgive her.</p>

<p>So occupied was she with this plan that she never
once spoke all the way to Porthcallis, and her father
at last looked quite anxiously over his paper at her, so
serious and grave was her face, and her eyes so very
troubled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t feeling homesick, are you?&#8221; he asked
gently.</p>

<p>Priscilla looked up with a start and then a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, father,&#8221; she said brightly, &#8220;&#8217;cause mother
and Geoffrey will come soon, and you too.&#8221;</p>

<p>And after that she tried to laugh and talk a good
deal, for she did not want any one to guess her secret.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you Loveday&#8217;s red cloak with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; it is in this basket, so that I can get at it
quite easily. I think she will be able to wear it back
from the station, don&#8217;t you, father? It seems rather
cold, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very cold!&#8221; laughed Dr. Carlyon, pretending
to shiver as the sea-breeze swept into the compartment.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
&#8220;Now, then, look out for the first glimpse of the sea,
and now for the station, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Loveday!&#8221; almost shrieked Priscilla. &#8220;She
is here. O father, father, she is here! She isn&#8217;t a
prisoner yet!&#8221; and, by Priscilla&#8217;s rapturous relief, Dr.
Carlyon realised how great, in spite of all, had been
her secret fears.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />


<small>PRISCILLA PAYS ANOTHER CALL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap3">LOVEDAY was not a prisoner, but she was somewhat
subdued and ashamed of herself, and
Priscilla, who felt very, very sorry for her,
and forgot all about her naughtiness and the
injury she had done, was quite troubled to
see how grave her father looked, and how sternly he
spoke to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this is a nice thing! Here am
I, called away from my patients and everything, to
come and help a little girl who cannot be trusted to
go a-visiting by herself but she must go and behave
disgracefully, and bring shame on us all! What have
you to say for yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, daddy,&#8221; cried the disgraced one, flinging
herself into his arms and burying her face on
his shoulder, while the spade and the bucket with
&#8220;Thomas&#8221; on it went clattering to the ground.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Dr. Carlyon had not put his harrowing
questions until they had passed the green and the
houses, and were in the little hotel where they were
to have dinner before going to interview Bessie. But
his stern silence all the way had impressed Loveday
more than any words could have done, and when at
last he spoke, her poor little troubled heart could bear
no more.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>&#8220;O daddy,&#8221; she sobbed, &#8220;I only meaned to be
very kind, and to make him happy &#8217;cause he&#8217;d lost his
son and was very unhappy, and we got up in the
morning when we were so sleepy and tired we didn&#8217;t
want to get up a bit, but it was to help him, and we
wanted to make it all look nice, and we thought &#8217;twas
the piskies put the old straw there, but it was Mr.
Winter did it&mdash;and how could we know? <i>Of course</i>
we shouldn&#8217;t have done it if we had! And then Mr.
Winter came out and caught us. Oh, &#8217;twas ever so
early, and he was so angry, he looked&mdash;oh, he looked as
if he would eat us! and he said such dreadful things,
and I told him all about it. I &#8217;splained everything,
but he doesn&#8217;t believe there are any fairies, and then
he took us indoors and locked us in a room while he
thought what he&#8217;d do with us, and I was &#8217;fraid he&#8217;d
heave us to cliff like we heaved the straw, but Aaron
said he&#8217;d know better than do that &#8217;cause he&#8217;d
be hanged for it. Aaron talked a lot when we were
locked in, and Mr. Winter wasn&#8217;t there, but he was
nearly crying before. I don&#8217;t think much of Aaron,
and I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll never like him any more! He said he
reckoned Mr. Winter would turn them out of their
cottage for what we had done, and &#8217;twould be all my
fault, and I told him he was a very bad, mean boy to
say such things, and if he didn&#8217;t take care all that he
ate would turn acid like it did to the wicked uncle in
the Babes of the Wood, but all he said was that he
wouldn&#8217;t mind that, if he could only get something
to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said her father, with a patient sigh, but
holding his erring little daughter very close, &#8220;you seem<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
to have had a pleasant ten minutes in your prison&mdash;but
get on with your story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten minutes!&#8221; cried Loveday, drawing back in
her surprise to look up at his face; &#8220;ten hours more
likely, daddy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! was it nearly night then when you came
out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no&mdash;but it was <i>quite</i> breakfast-time when
we got home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see&mdash;it seemed like ten hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes!&#8221; sighed Loveday, with a very sober
shake of her curly head; &#8220;and it was such a dirty,
horrid little room. I don&#8217;t think Mrs. Tucker can be
a very clean person,&#8221; she added, in a grave confidential
tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind Mrs. Tucker&mdash;get on with your
story. I don&#8217;t suppose you were very clean either at
that time in the morning!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;you see we always washed when we got
up the second time. We were in too great a hurry
the first time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did Mr. Winter say when he came back
and let you out?&#8221; asked Dr. Carlyon.</p>

<p>&#8220;He said he hadn&#8217;t been able to think of a punishment
yet, so we might go home then, and he would
send for us later. Aaron said that was because it was
going to be something dreadful, and I wanted to run
away to some place where I could never be caught;
but Aaron said it would be mean to go and leave him
to face it all. Would it, father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very. I am extremely glad you did not do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, daddy, s&#8217;posing he sends me away from you!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
What shall I do?&#8221; and the blue eyes filled with tears
again.</p>

<p>And at the sight of them, and the thought of such
a dreadful possibility, Priscilla, who had been standing
near with a very, very serious face, listening to all the
harrowing story, almost wept too, and told her precious
secret in her desire to comfort her little sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear little Loveday, don&#8217;t cry any more!
You won&#8217;t be sent away&mdash;I am sure you won&#8217;t. And
just look here at the lovely present I&#8217;ve got for you!
Father, put her down, that she may try it on.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the moment, at any rate, all Loveday&#8217;s woes
vanished, and Priscilla forgot her cares, too, in the
excitement and happiness at the pleasure in store for
Loveday. And then the basket was opened, and out
came the parcel, and the red cloak was unfolded, and
displayed before Loveday&#8217;s dazzled eyes; and her
delight was as great as even Priscilla had hoped it
would be.</p>

<p>&#8220;For me!&#8221; she cried&mdash;&#8220;<i>me</i>! For my very own!
O Prissy, how lovely! What a dear! Let me put it
on quick. Do you think it will suit me?&#8221; And in
another moment the pretty red cloak was round her,
and the hood drawn over her tumbled curls, while
Prissy, like a little mother, knelt to button it round
her, managing as best she could with her one hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I look <i>very</i> pretty in it?&#8221; asked Loveday,
appealing, quite unembarrassed, to her father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, not so <i>very</i> plain,&#8221; said her father, pretending
to study her very critically. &#8220;I have seen
you look worse,&#8221; though in his heart he thought he
had seldom seen anything so charming as the little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
flushed face, the eyes still bright with unshed tears,
surrounded by its tangle of curls and the red hood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has Prissie got one?&#8221; she asked, quite undisturbed
by her father&#8217;s remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;mine is blue,&#8221; cried Priscilla, dragging hers
out of the basket too. &#8220;I like mine best for me, but
I like the red best for you. Look, isn&#8217;t mine lovely!&#8221;
and she put the cloak on over her little print frock.</p>

<p>Then came a long comparison and examination of
both. &#8220;I think I like my buttons best,&#8221; said Loveday,
at the end of the inspection, &#8220;but you have a
clasp on yours. Never mind&mdash;perhaps I shall get a
clasp too some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then followed the long story of Priscilla&#8217;s call on
Lady Carey, and of Lady Carey&#8217;s sending for the
parcel, and every detail of Priscilla&#8217;s visit, even to
the chair and the bell-pull; and it took so long to tell
that the servant came in and laid the cloth and placed
the dinner on the table before it was all done.</p>

<p>Loveday was so delighted with her cloak she could
not be persuaded to take it off even for dinner, so
she wore it throughout the meal, and all the way to
Bessie&#8217;s too, &#8220;because,&#8221; as she said, &#8220;it matched her
bucket so beautifully, and would give Bessie such a
surprise.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Bessie really was surprised to see her little lady
come back enveloped in a long, warm red cloak, with
the hood drawn snugly over her head, especially as
that same little lady had in the morning protested
that it was too hot to bear even a cotton coat over her
cotton frock.</p>

<p>Then Priscilla having been welcomed and kissed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
and crooned over by Bessie, and the cloaks having been
admired, and Aaron introduced and allowed to run
away and hide, Priscilla and Loveday were sent out
to amuse themselves on the beach, while Dr. Carlyon
talked over all the dreadful doings of his younger
daughter and Bessie&#8217;s son.</p>

<p>It was then that Priscilla breathed to Loveday her
great plan of going up to call on Mr. Winter. At
first she had not intended to let Loveday into the
secret, but she soon saw how impossible it would be
to get away from her, that there would be a hue and
cry if she were missed, and that matters then would
be worse than ever. So Loveday was told, and her
help proved to be of the greatest use.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Prissy, &#8220;if father is going up
there this afternoon, I needn&#8217;t go.&#8221;</p>

<p>But they soon learnt, to their surprise, that Dr.
Carlyon had no intention of going, for, after his talk
with Bessie, he came out to them on the beach to
say that Bessie had given him the addresses of some
lodgings, and he was now going to see if either of them
would suit.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you had better not come with me, dear,&#8221;
he said to Prissy. &#8220;You look tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla agreed, not because she did not want to
go, but because she wanted to do something else.</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but,&#8221; she began nervously, &#8220;father, aren&#8217;t
you going to see Mr. Winter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, dear,&#8221; he said quite cheerfully, and not at
all as though he were alarmed. &#8220;I think, from what
Bessie tells me, that I had better wait until I hear
something more from Mr. Winter himself before I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
take any steps in the matter. Loveday, would you like
to come with me or to stay with Priscilla? I expect
you would rather stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;d rather go with you, I think,&#8221; said Loveday,
her mind full of Priscilla&#8217;s plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Priscilla will have plenty of you, and I
haven&#8217;t seen you for a long time,&#8221; said Dr. Carlyon,
&#8220;so come along. Prissy, you had better rest till we
come back. Now, then, Loveday, are you ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>And off they went. Priscilla felt rather deceitful
as they left her, and she felt even more so when Bessie
showed her to the little room that she and Loveday
were now to share.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, missie,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you shall have a nice
sleep; the house will be very quiet. Aaron is going
to Melland with his father, and I shall be sitting
outside the front door with my sewing. If you want
me, you have only to call.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla thanked her, and thought, with thankfulness,
that things seemed to be arranging themselves on
purpose for her. She felt rather troubled about it,
but she really had taken fresh alarm at her father&#8217;s
remark that he should wait until he heard more.
&#8220;Why will they put it off?&#8221; she thought anxiously;
&#8220;they will leave it until too late, and the policeman
will come before they have done anything, and then
it will be no good!&#8221; It seemed to her very, very
foolish and rash, and she felt quite glad that Loveday
was in her father&#8217;s care, for there she would be safer
than anywhere.</p>

<p>She went into the bedroom and shut the door,
and lay down for a little while, until, at last, she heard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
Aaron and his father start, and Bessie settle down
under the verandah to her sewing. When Priscilla had
heard her singing softly to herself for some time, she
felt that at last it would be safe to start. To cover her
light cotton frock, which would have made her very
conspicuous as she mounted the cliff, she put on her
blue cloak, hood and all; but she carried her hat beneath
it, for she thought it would be more fitting to
be wearing a hat when making a first call, and one of
such importance too.</p>

<p>Loveday had told her exactly how to go, and
Bessie having been unable to get the bars put up at
the window yet, Priscilla slipped out easily enough,
and was soon hurrying up the cliff. At first all her
fear was of being seen, and stopped, but later, when
she neared the top, other fears seized her. Mr. Winter
seemed suddenly to grow almost too formidable to face,
and when she reached the gate she hesitated a moment,
really too nervous to go a step farther.</p>

<p>But she thought of Loveday, who would be all the
time thinking of her, and counting on her interference;
and she thought of all the dreadful things that might
happen, making herself picture the very worst, to help
to get her courage up. And then she quickly opened
the gate, walked gravely up to the door, and knocked
before she had time to give way to her fears again.</p>

<small>MR. WINTER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE housekeeper, grim and silent as usual,
opened the door. Her look and manner
alone were sufficient to alarm Priscilla,
and send her home with errand undone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is&mdash;is Mr. Winter at home?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he is,&#8221; answered the woman. She was so
absorbed in staring at Priscilla, and studying every
detail of her face and figure and clothing, one could
have been excused for thinking she had not really
taken in what was said to her. Under her rude stare
and forbidding manner, a faint pink flush came into
Priscilla&#8217;s pale cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Mr. Winter at home, please?&#8221; repeated
Priscilla; adding, as firmly as she could, &#8220;I want to
see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you can&#8217;t,&#8221; answered the housekeeper
rudely; &#8220;he don&#8217;t see visitors. What&#8217;s your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think Mr. Winter would see me,&#8221; said Priscilla
eagerly. The fear that after all she might not be able
to reach him with her appeal made her desperate. She
had never contemplated failure of that kind. &#8220;My
name is Carlyon, but I don&#8217;t suppose Mr. Winter
would know it. I want very much indeed to see him,
though. It is most important.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>&#8220;What for? What can a little girl like you want
to be troubling a gentleman like Mr. Winter for?&#8221;
she asked roughly. &#8220;If you&#8217;re come begging for clubs
or charities or things, I can tell you at once, it isn&#8217;t any
good, and you can run away as quick as you come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I am not begging,&#8221; said Priscilla emphatically&mdash;&#8220;not
for money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we haven&#8217;t got any flowers or fruit to give
away. I can tell &#8217;ee that too. So you may as well
run &#8217;long home to where you come from.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t speak like that,&#8221; said Priscilla indignantly;
&#8220;you shouldn&#8217;t be rude.&#8221; She was hurt
and insulted, and she felt that this woman would prevent
her seeing her master if she possibly could. &#8220;I
spoke quite civilly to you, and I&#8217;ve come on important
business, and I am sure Mr. Winter would see me if
he knew I wanted him. But it doesn&#8217;t matter; I
will write to him,&#8221; and she turned away with great
dignity, but only just in time to prevent the woman
from seeing the tears that would well up in her eyes.</p>

<p>Very angry indeed, Mrs. Tucker shut the door with
a bang, while Priscilla walked down the gravel path
with great dignity, her head held high, but with, oh!
such an aching heart, such despair and disappointment;
and then, suddenly, a gentleman appeared at her side
and was speaking to her quite kindly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; he asked, not ungently;
&#8220;you are in trouble? Can I do anything for
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Just for a second he had thought this must be his
little culprit of a day or two since, but when he looked
again he saw that the strange visitor was taller and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
older, and her face, though like that other one, was
paler, and thinner, and graver.</p>

<p>For a moment Priscilla could not control the
quivering of her lips, or choke back the tears which
had forced their way up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted to see Mr. Winter,&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;I
want very much to see him, and the woman was
so rude, she wouldn&#8217;t even ask him if he would
see me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know; I heard her,&#8221; said the stranger sternly.
&#8220;But it is all right. I am Mr. Winter. What do
you want with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>And then when she was face to face with him,
with the morose recluse, the mysterious tyrant who
was going to do all sorts of unkind things to Loveday
and Aaron, Priscilla could not for a moment think
of anything she wanted to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please,&#8221; she stammered, wondering where she
could begin, &#8220;I have come to&mdash;to&mdash;to ask you to
forgive my little sister, Loveday Carlyon. I know
she was mischievous, but she didn&#8217;t mean to be&mdash;she
didn&#8217;t, really; she wanted to be kind to you, because
they said&mdash;because&mdash;oh, because she thought you were
sad and lonely, and she&mdash;and she&mdash;oh! you won&#8217;t have
her punished <i>very</i> severely, will you, or sent to gaol?
Oh, <i>please</i>, don&#8217;t! She will never, never do such a
thing again, I know!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Um! She won&#8217;t, won&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no!&#8221; said Priscilla eagerly; &#8220;never! She
really did think it was the piskies that put the straw
there to annoy you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; said Mr. Winter sharply. Then he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
added, more gently: &#8220;The idea of any one believing
such rubbish in these days!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Loveday does,&#8221; said Priscilla earnestly&mdash;&#8220;she
does, really&mdash;and&mdash;and I want her to go on believing.
<i>I</i> did once, and it was, oh! <i>ever</i> so much nicer than
now when I know it isn&#8217;t any use to. I wish I&#8217;d
never been told there aren&#8217;t any fairies, really. When
you think there are, it seems as if such lots of beautiful
things may happen, you never know what, and&mdash;and
it always seems as if they were going to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, ay, little girl,&#8221; said Mr. Winter, looking down
at her thoughtfully, &#8220;it is very sad when folk don&#8217;t
leave us fairies, or&mdash;or anything else to believe in.
But they won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla did not know what reply to make to this,
so she made none. After a pause Mr. Winter looked
at her again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look pale and tired,&#8221; he said, trying still to
speak coldly, but not succeeding very well. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t look as strong as that mischievous sister of
yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been ill,&#8221; said Priscilla, and she told him
of the accident with the swing, and throwing back her
cloak to show him her arm still in its sling, she saw,
and for the first time remembered, her hat. For a
moment a hot blush dyed her face, and then she burst
into a hearty peal of laughter. At the sound of it
Mr. Winter started, then grew even paler than he had
been. No sound of childish laughter had been heard
in that place since the day his boy left him to start
on his fatal expedition.</p>

<p>&#8220;I meant to have put it on,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
I reached your gate; I thought it was more&mdash;more
right to have on a hat when one paid a call. I only
put on my cloak because I was afraid my dress would
show as I came up the cliff, and I was afraid some
one would see me and stop me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Winter had recovered himself by this time,
and seeing that she could but badly manage with one
hand to slip back the hood and put on her hat, he
actually helped her. At the touch of the soft curls,
at the frank, grateful glance of the childish eyes, a
new sense of life and happiness ran through his chilled
veins, a new peace came to the heart that had for so
long waged a bitter, resentful war against God, himself,
and his fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>When the hat was satisfactorily adjusted, a sudden
silence fell upon them; his mind and heart were
teeming with thoughts and sensations that to Priscilla
would have been incomprehensible. Priscilla was
wondering what she could say and do next. He had
not said he would forgive Loveday, and she did not
like to leave without his promise, and oh! she was
feeling so tired she did not know how to begin her
pleading again. She <i>must</i>, though. She felt that;
and then she would go away, and when she got out of
sight she would rest a little before she went all down
that steep path again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Winter&mdash;you haven&#8217;t said yet, but will you
forgive Loveday, please?&#8221; she asked, suddenly growing
shy and nervous again. But it was the weariness, the
weakness of her voice that struck her hearer most. He
looked sharply at her, and her pale, wan little face sent
a pang to his heart, a pang he could not understand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>&#8220;Yes, of course, child, of course,&#8221; he said hastily.
&#8220;I am not an ogre. I was only pretending to be, to
frighten the two young scamps a little. I did not
intend to punish them any further. You may run
home and tell your sister what I say. But,&#8221; he added
abruptly, &#8220;you are not fit to walk all the way back;
you have walked too far already, and I have kept you
standing all this time. Come in and rest for a few
minutes, and have a glass of milk. You will get home
in half the time after it.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Priscilla hesitated. She was shy of penetrating
that gloomy house, with only this stranger, of whom
she still felt some awe, and that dreadful woman,
whom she frankly disliked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would rather not,&#8221; he said, quick to notice
her hesitation; &#8220;don&#8217;t be afraid to speak out, child.
I quite understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Priscilla noticed the hurt tone in his voice, and
was touched. &#8220;I would like to very much, thank you,&#8221;
she said weakly. &#8220;I am dreadfully tired,&#8221; she added,
almost as though the words escaped her against her
will. The next moment she was crossing the bare
stone hall into which Loveday had peered so enviously,
and was admitted to Mr. Winter&#8217;s own private sitting-room,
which no one but himself had entered for years.</p>

<p>Of all the women in this wide world, Mr. Winter&#8217;s
housekeeper was at that moment the most astounded,
and what to make of things, and of the change in her
master, she did not know. But in her heart she very
much wished that she had treated this little visitor
more civilly when she had first come knocking at
the door.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>Priscilla sat in a big arm-chair, and drank milk and
ate biscuits, and Mr. Winter sat in another and
stared out of window, his mind absorbed in thoughts.
They wandered far and wide, yet when, presently,
Priscilla&#8217;s voice broke the silence, both his and hers
must have been hovering near the same subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Potts,&#8221; she broke out suddenly&mdash;&#8220;she is a
friend of mine at home,&#8221; she explained&mdash;&#8220;Miss Potts
couldn&#8217;t bear the sight of the sea either; it had
swallowed up <i>all her</i> family, all but her and her
mother.&#8221; Mr. Winter&#8217;s eyelids quivered, and his face
contracted sharply, but Priscilla could not see his face,
or she might have paused in what she was saying. As
it was, though, she continued: &#8220;But <i>she</i> left it. She
didn&#8217;t draw her blinds because she couldn&#8217;t bear to
look at it, but she went right away, and&mdash;and she told
me she had been <i>ever</i> so much happier ever since.&#8221;</p>

<p>A deep silence followed her remarks, a silence which
presently frightened Priscilla, and as it continued, she
slipped off her chair and crept to the door. She felt
that she had offended past forgiveness. &#8220;I ought not
to have mentioned the sea, or the blinds, or let him
know I knew anything about the story,&#8221; she thought
with a sudden, overwhelming sense of her own want
of tact. But when she reached the door she paused;
she could not, after all his kindness, go and leave him
without a word. So she crept back again very gently
and very slowly, until she reached his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I am dreadfully sorry,&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;I did
not mean to hurt you.&#8221; Then, as still he did not
speak, in real distress she laid her hand on his thin hand
as it rested on his knee, while the other supported his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
head. &#8220;Mr. Winter,&#8221; she said, in a frightened voice,
her lip quivering, &#8220;I am so sorry; I did not mean
to hurt you, only I&mdash;I felt so sorry for you, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t hurt me, child,&#8221; he said at last,
speaking very slowly, in a curious still voice; &#8220;it is
I who have hurt myself all these years. I was very
glad to hear about your friend. I am grateful to you
for telling me about her. She was a wise and brave
woman. Now,&#8221; rousing himself and rising, &#8220;if you
are rested you would like to go home, I expect. I
will see you to the gate.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the gate he took the little hand she held out.
&#8220;You will come and see me again, I hope?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; said Priscilla warmly; &#8220;I will come
quite soon, if you would like me to.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she walked away she turned every now and then
to wave her hand to the solitary-looking old man who
stood at his gate, and watched her until she had disappeared
from his sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see him? What did he say? Was he
very cross?&#8221; whispered Loveday anxiously, rushing
to find her the moment they returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&mdash;oh, he asked me to come again,&#8221; said
Priscilla absently.</p>

<p>&#8220;But didn&#8217;t he say anything about me and
Aaron?&#8221;&mdash;with a surprised and disappointed look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes. He told me to say he forgave you, and
he wouldn&#8217;t think anything more about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; cried Loveday, in a voice full of reproach,
&#8220;you might have told me at once, when you knew
how anxious I was. I have been thinking about it all
the time I&#8217;ve been out. You don&#8217;t look a bit as though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
you had good news for me; I thought you would
have been&mdash;oh, <i>ever</i> so glad that I wasn&#8217;t to be sent
to prison;&#8221; and Loveday&#8217;s lip actually quivered with
disappointment at Priscilla&#8217;s seeming indifference.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am!&#8221; cried Priscilla, rousing herself; &#8220;I am
so glad; and, oh dear, there are such lots of things to
be glad about. I don&#8217;t know which to think about
first.&#8221;</p>

<small>IN WHICH A GREAT MANY THINGS HAPPEN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOUR such happy, beautiful weeks followed.
Mrs. Carlyon and Geoffrey came down to
Porthcallis within a few days, and they all
settled into the comfortable rooms Dr. Carlyon
had taken for them. Loveday was very
sorry to leave Bessie and Aaron and the dear little
bedroom; but they went every day to &#8220;Bessie&#8217;s
beach,&#8221; as they called it, for it was their favourite
play-place. Each day they thought they knew all
the rocks and pools by heart, yet every time they
came again they found fresh ones.</p>

<p>Very often, too, Mrs. Carlyon engaged John Lobb
to row them along the coast in his best boat, and they
would land at some of the nice little bays and coves
and have their dinner or tea, and light a fire and boil
the kettle.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_f154.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;<span class="smcap">They would light a fire and boil the kettle.</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>The red bucket &#8220;Thomas&#8221; grew to look quite
shabby with the hard usage it had, and so many of its
letters got knocked off that it was difficult at last to know
what the name was meant to be. Priscilla had chosen
a green bucket with &#8220;Mary&#8221; on it, as she could not
get one with her first name. The colour did not go very
well with her blue cloak, but she did not want to use
them together very often, and when she did she solved
the difficulty by carrying the bucket underneath the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
cloak. Sometimes they went for picnics on the Downs
on the top of the cliff, and one day when they were
up there Priscilla saw Mr. Winter, and, running up
to him, brought him over and introduced him to her
mother. He seemed rather shy at first and not very
happy, but the next time they met him he came up to
them of his own accord and talked to them for a while,
and as the days went on they even induced him to
join them at their picnic teas, and when he had done
so once or twice he seemed really to enjoy himself, and
would ramble about with them for quite a long time,
saying little, but evidently interested in all they said
and did.</p>

<p>Priscilla was his most constant companion.
Geoffrey, at first particularly, reminded him too painfully
of his own dead boy, and he himself reminded
Loveday of the mortifying occasion when he had
locked her up, a prisoner. As time went on they
often talked of the escapade, and laughed about it,
but Loveday could not at first see any joke in it, or
quite throw off her awe of her captor, and preferred
to race and tear about with Geoffrey, sharing his
dangers and adventures.</p>

<p>Often when Priscilla was tired she would find her
new old friend by her side, and with his arm to lean on
they would saunter on slowly together and talk and
talk. Such long conversations they had, though it
was generally Priscilla who was the talker, but that
was because he asked her so many questions about
their home, and their games, and their lessons, and
their doings, and he seemed so interested in every
little thing that Priscilla told him that she thought
perhaps it helped him to feel more cheerful and forget<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
his own troubles. So she chattered on to him very
willingly.</p>

<p>She did not have all the talk to herself, though,
for sometimes he would tell her stories of the time
when he was a boy, and all sorts of other interesting
tales; but her mother had told her so seriously never
to ask him questions, or speak of anything that would
be likely to arouse sad memories, that poor Priscilla
was not quite certain what she might say, and what
she must not, and really felt easier when she was telling
him of their own little doings.</p>

<p>One day she told him all about Lady Carey and
the cloaks, and he seemed very interested. &#8220;Is that
the pretty cloak I first saw you in?&#8221; he asked; and
when Priscilla said, &#8220;Yes, it was,&#8221; he said, &#8220;A very
sensible clever woman she must be to make such a
charming garment. I have never seen any I like
so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another day she told him about Miss Potts, and
what an interesting person she was, and how she was
an &#8220;only&#8221;; so she, Priscilla, tried to be a sort of sister
to her, and went quite often to see her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to know Miss Potts,&#8221; he said, and
Priscilla knew that he was thinking of the story she
had blurted out to him so thoughtlessly that first day.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you could,&#8221; she said eagerly. &#8220;Oh, I
wish you would come to Trelint and see her, and see
our house, and Betsy and&mdash;everything. I am sure
you would like it. Miss Potts loves Trelint. She
told me she felt at home there at once, and ever
so happy, and she has never wanted to go anywhere
else since. I am sure you would love Trelint if
you came.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>&#8220;I feel sure I should,&#8221; said Mr. Winter. &#8220;Perhaps
I will come some day. I dare say I shall; in fact, I
have been thinking about it a good deal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, have you? How lovely!&#8221; cried Priscilla,
really pleased. &#8220;It won&#8217;t seem so hard to leave
Porthcallis now.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the last days had come, and the end of the
visit was very near. Already there had been talk of
trains, and some farewell visits had been paid, and
they all felt very sad, for they loved the little place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it isn&#8217;t as fine in some ways as Porthcallis,&#8221;
she remarked, after a short pause, beginning
to wonder if she had painted home too glowingly,
and so prepared a disappointment for a new-comer
to the place. &#8220;There is no&#8221;&mdash;she had nearly added
&#8220;sea there,&#8221; but checked herself just in time&mdash;&#8220;nothing,
I mean, <i>very famous</i>, like ruins, and tombs,
and castles, and things, but it is very&mdash;very homey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not particularly fond of sight-seeing,&#8221; said
Mr. Winter, &#8220;and I would prefer a home to a ruin.
It seems to me I have been living in the latter too
long already,&#8221; he added, half to himself. &#8220;Now let
us go and find your mother. I want to ask her to
bring you all to tea with me at my house to-morrow.
I hope you will not mind giving up a part of your last
whole day. Would you like to come, little one?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Priscilla was speechless. Even she,
child as she was, understood a little what this invitation
must have cost him. But she quickly recovered
herself and remembered her manners.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I would love to!&#8221; she cried warmly; &#8220;we
all would, I know.&#8221; But she added in her own sedate
little way: &#8220;Won&#8217;t we be a great trouble to you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>Mr. Winter smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a trouble, child.&#8221;</p>

<p>They soon overtook Mrs. Carlyon, who gladly
agreed to the plan, and thanked Mr. Winter warmly,
and soon after that they parted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was with very varied feelings that they all
climbed the cliff the next day to Mr. Winter&#8217;s home,
and walked slowly up the pebbled path. Geoffrey was
full of curiosity and interest; Loveday was a little
shy of again entering her prison, but interested too;
Mrs. Carlyon was very thankful, and in her heart very
glad, for it seemed to her that it might be the beginning
of brighter, happier days for the poor, lonely, sad old
man; Priscilla, too, dimly felt the same thing, and she
wanted, oh, so much! that he should be less sad.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tucker let them in, glum as usual, but more
civil in manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you please to walk inside and sit down,&#8221; she
said, showing them into a little bare room where there
was no sign of any preparations for tea, no flowers, nor
even chairs enough for them all. &#8220;The master will
be here in a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>And in less than a moment he came in.</p>

<p>As soon as their eyes fell on him standing in the
doorway, two at least of them&mdash;Priscilla and her
mother&mdash;noticed a change in him; they could not
have said whether they saw or felt it, or in what the
change lay, and when he came forward to shake hands
he seemed only a little quieter, a little more sad than
usual, and somewhat more absent-minded. He welcomed
them very cordially, but after the first greetings
a silence fell, then:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>&#8220;Will you come this way?&#8221; he said, rising and
moving towards the door. He spoke in a nervous,
strained manner. &#8220;I have had tea laid in the&mdash;the
drawing-room. It is a room I do not often
use.&#8221; As they rose to follow him he laid his hand on
Priscilla&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;May Miss Priscilla and I lead
the way?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>It was a curiously silent little procession that
straggled from the one room to the other&mdash;Mrs.
Carlyon full of surmise as to what was to follow,
Geoffrey and Loveday too absorbed in interest at
being in the house of mystery, as they had always
considered it, to notice anything unusual.</p>

<p>But as soon as the drawing-room door was opened,
Mrs. Carlyon began to understand. &#8220;This is one of
the closed rooms, and for us he has at last opened it,&#8221;
she thought; and once more a deep pang of tender
pity filled her heart.</p>

<p>Mr. Winter walked in without looking or speaking;
Priscilla walked beside him, her hand held fast in his,
and even through all her wonderment she noticed how
his hand trembled. Straight across the room they
went, and right up to the windows where the blinds
were still fast drawn. &#8220;I want you to be the first to
draw these up,&#8221; he said gently, and Priscilla, a little
nervously, but very gladly, pulled the cords, and let in
the beautiful air and sunlight.</p>

<p>For a moment they stood there, Priscilla gazing
with wide eyes at the glorious view which spread
before her, glorious, yet almost awe-inspiring; Mr.
Winter looking down at her, as though he could not
yet force himself to let his eyes rest on what he had
so long shut out. He turned away at last, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
leaving her standing there alone, went over to Mrs.
Carlyon, who was lingering in the doorway trying to
keep back her tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive an old man&#8217;s sentiment,&#8221; he said to her,
with his gentle sad smile; &#8220;as she was the first to let
sunshine into my life again, I wanted her to be the first
to let it into my house too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, I understand,&#8221; said Mrs. Carlyon softly;
&#8220;you are very brave.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Loveday, with a cry of joy, relieved the
tension of the moment, and every one felt grateful to
the unconscious little maiden.</p>

<p>&#8220;O mummy!&#8221; she cried excitedly, &#8220;mummy!
do look! Here is a dear dinky little cup with
&#8216;Loveday&#8217; on it. Then they do paint &#8216;Loveday&#8217;
on things sometimes, and that woman told a story
when she said they didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Winter turned to her with a pleased smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was my Grannie&#8217;s cup,&#8221; he said, &#8220;made on
purpose for her, and that was her name; and as you
are the only other Loveday I have ever known, I am
going to ask you to use it, and after that to accept it
from me as a little keepsake from the ogre to the pisky.&#8221;</p>

<p>At which Loveday gasped and squealed again more
delightedly than ever, and from that moment forgave
him for her humiliation, even going so far as to admit
him as one of her very best friends.</p>

<p>It was a very pleasant tea that, and one none of
them ever forgot, though it was not entirely joyous,
owing to the many memories called up, and the
thought of the parting on the morrow, which was
hanging over them all.</p>

<p>But when the next morning came and the actual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
parting, the spirits of most of them were not as low
as they had thought they would be, for they were
going home, and that is always pleasant, and there
was the journey and the drive. And what an exciting,
bustling time it was, packing up the last things and
getting off. The children had so many more treasures
too&mdash;buckets and spades, shells and pebbles and seaweeds;
and Loveday had her tea-cup too, which had
to be packed with special care in Mrs. Carlyon&#8217;s best
hat-box. And then, when at last they reached the
wind-swept station, and Priscilla in her blue cloak,
and Loveday in her red one, were standing on the
platform, who should appear but Mr. Winter himself
to see them off!</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I might be of some use in helping
you,&#8221; he said kindly. &#8220;Is there anything I can do?
Tell me, please, if there is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, will you please hold this?&#8221; gasped Loveday
eagerly, pointing to the hat-box which she and Priscilla
were guarding. &#8220;My cup is in it, and I am so
afraid some one will run into us and joggle it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Winter took the box at once into his care, and
then turned to help their mother, and when the train
came in he found them a nice comfortable compartment
all to themselves, and having first placed the
precious hat-box in safety, and arranged a dozen other
things in the rack, he then helped in Priscilla and
Loveday and Mrs. Carlyon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; he said, when at last the whistle blew
to warn them they were about to start. &#8220;Good-bye,
good-bye, children, and I hope you will write to me
sometimes, and tell me what you are doing, and how
Miss Potts gets on, for I shall be very lonely without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
you,&#8221; and he stepped quietly out of the carriage as
though half ashamed of having said so much; and the
last thing they saw as they rolled away was Mr. Winter
standing alone on the little bare platform, the wind
blowing his white hair about as he waved his hat
to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how we should ever have got off
without Mr. Winter,&#8221; said Nurse, who had taken a
great liking to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I; nor how we shall get on at home without
him,&#8221; said Mrs. Carlyon gravely; &#8220;I think he will
have to come to Trelint.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; sighed Priscilla. &#8220;I am sure he will
be very lonely without us. I must write to him very
often, to cheer him up.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Priscilla did. Sometimes it was difficult.
She felt disinclined, or she thought there was nothing
to say, or she could not spell the words she wanted
to use, but she very seldom failed altogether, and she
would not have done so at all, had she known how
her funny little badly written letters were prized by
her old friend.</p>

<p>One day there came a letter from Mr. Winter which
sent Priscilla dancing joyously through the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Scylla,&#8221; it said&mdash;Mr. Winter had called
her &#8220;Scylla,&#8221; because he said that as the little blue
flower was the first to push its way through the hard
frosty ground, so she had been the first to push her
way through his frosty nature:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My dear Scylla</span>,&mdash;Your last letter interested me
much, and what you told me of the old house next
to Miss Potts made me so anxious to see it that I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
determined to come over to Trelint for a few days
to have a look at it; so be sure that no one else takes
it first. The front of it so close to the street that I
can see your house from it, sounds very enticing, and
the old-fashioned garden at the back sounds as if it
was made on purpose for me; and if I like it as much
as I think I shall from what you say, I should not be
surprised if, like Miss Potts herself, I felt so at home
in Trelint I should never want to leave it again, and
then you would be relieved of the task of writing to
your dull old friend,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Matthew Winter</span>.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>A very few days later, Mr. Winter did come to
Trelint, and Mrs. Carlyon and the children went with
him to inspect the comfortable, roomy old house which
stood beside Miss Potts&#8217; little old-fashioned house and
shop, without humbling hers or losing its own dignity.
And everything in the house seemed right; and the
garden was beautiful, large, and old, and well-filled
with every kind of flower that one loves best, and
many kinds of fruits too.</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>must</i> have this,&#8221; said Mr. Winter, and he spoke
so eagerly and gaily it was a treat to hear him. &#8220;I
can just imagine you children racing about here and
playing all sorts of games. You will let them come,
won&#8217;t you, Mrs. Carlyon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, indeed, yes,&#8221; she cried laughingly; &#8220;they
will come&mdash;the question is, will they go? You must
see to it that they do, Mr. Winter. I am sure they
will always be wanting to be here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It really is a dear old house, and the garden is
lovely,&#8221; she said afterwards to her husband; &#8220;but I
believe he would have taken it if it had been the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
most wretched and inconvenient place imaginable, he
seemed so determined to come here.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;And it all came,&#8221; said Loveday solemnly, when
they were talking over the wonderful event amongst
themselves&mdash;&#8220;it all came about through my being a
pisky in his garden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or a prisoner in his house,&#8221; jeered Geoffrey, to
tease her.</p>

<p>&#8220;It really began further back than either,&#8221; said
Priscilla, &#8220;for if it hadn&#8217;t been for our accident Loveday
wouldn&#8217;t have been sent to Porthcallis, and so&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So really you have me to thank for it all,&#8221; cried
Geoffrey, &#8220;for I put up the swing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if you had put it up properly it wouldn&#8217;t
have broken, and there might not have been any
accident,&#8221; agreed Priscilla. &#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Loveday, who had been cogitating
quietly for some time, &#8220;it was through me, after all;
for if Mrs. Wall hadn&#8217;t been so long changing her
frock, and kept me waiting so, I should have been in
the swing too&#8221; (excitedly); &#8220;and then I should have
fallen out, and p&#8217;r&#8217;aps been killed, and then I wouldn&#8217;t
have gone to Porthcallis, and you&#8221; (growing more and
more eager) &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t any of you have known Mr.
Winter, so you see &#8217;twas through me, after all.&#8221; And
to her immense surprise she was for once allowed to
have the last word.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
